class Distribution(_Distribution):
    """
    Distribution with support for tests and package data

    This is an enhanced version of 'distutils.dist.Distribution' that
    effectively adds the following new optional keyword arguments to 'setup()':

     'install_requires' -- a string or sequence of strings specifying project
        versions that the distribution requires when installed, in the format
        used by 'pkg_resources.require()'.  They will be installed
        automatically when the package is installed.  If you wish to use
        packages that are not available in PyPI, or want to give your users an
        alternate download location, you can add a 'find_links' option to the
        '[easy_install]' section of your project's 'setup.cfg' file, and then
        setuptools will scan the listed web pages for links that satisfy the
        requirements.

     'extras_require' -- a dictionary mapping names of optional "extras" to the
        additional requirement(s) that using those extras incurs. For example,
        this::

            extras_require = dict(reST = ["docutils>=0.3", "reSTedit"])

        indicates that the distribution can optionally provide an extra
        capability called "reST", but it can only be used if docutils and
        reSTedit are installed.  If the user installs your package using
        EasyInstall and requests one of your extras, the corresponding
        additional requirements will be installed if needed.

     'package_data' -- a dictionary mapping package names to lists of filenames
        or globs to use to find data files contained in the named packages.
        If the dictionary has filenames or globs listed under '""' (the empty
        string), those names will be searched for in every package, in addition
        to any names for the specific package.  Data files found using these
        names/globs will be installed along with the package, in the same
        location as the package.  Note that globs are allowed to reference
        the contents of non-package subdirectories, as long as you use '/' as
        a path separator.  (Globs are automatically converted to
        platform-specific paths at runtime.)

    In addition to these new keywords, this class also has several new methods
    for manipulating the distribution's contents.  For example, the 'include()'
    and 'exclude()' methods can be thought of as in-place add and subtract
    commands that add or remove packages, modules, extensions, and so on from
    the distribution.

        Currently, this method only supports inclusion for attributes that are
        lists or tuples.  If you need to add support for adding to other
        attributes in this or a subclass, you can add an '_include_X' method,
        where 'X' is the name of the attribute.  The method will be called with
        the value passed to 'include()'.  So, 'dist.include(foo={"bar":"baz"})'
        will try to call 'dist._include_foo({"bar":"baz"})', which can then
        handle whatever special inclusion logic is needed.

        the 'exclude_package()' method, so all of the package's contained
