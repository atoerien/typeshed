    Byte-compile a collection of Python source files to .pyc
    files in a __pycache__ subdirectory.  'py_files' is a list
    of files to compile; any files that don't end in ".py" are silently
    skipped.  'optimize' must be one of the following:
      0 - don't optimize
      1 - normal optimization (like "python -O")
      2 - extra optimization (like "python -OO")
    If 'force' is true, all files are recompiled regardless of
    timestamps.

    The source filename encoded in each bytecode file defaults to the
    filenames listed in 'py_files'; you can modify these with 'prefix' and
    'basedir'.  'prefix' is a string that will be stripped off of each
    source filename, and 'base_dir' is a directory name that will be
    prepended (after 'prefix' is stripped).  You can supply either or both
    (or neither) of 'prefix' and 'base_dir', as you wish.

    If 'dry_run' is true, doesn't actually do anything that would
    affect the filesystem.

    Byte-compilation is either done directly in this interpreter process
    with the standard py_compile module, or indirectly by writing a
    temporary script and executing it.  Normally, you should let
    'byte_compile()' figure out to use direct compilation or not (see
    the source for details).  The 'direct' flag is used by the script
    generated in indirect mode; unless you know what you're doing, leave
    it set to None.
