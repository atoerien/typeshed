    ``missing`` controls how to handle a missing source file:

    - error (default): allow the ``stat()`` call to fail.
    - ignore: silently disregard any missing source files.
    - newer: treat missing source files as "target out of date". This
      mode is handy in "dry-run" mode: it will pretend to carry out
      commands that wouldn't work because inputs are missing, but
      that doesn't matter because dry-run won't run the commands.
