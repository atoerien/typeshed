"""
Provides classes to represent module version numbers (one class for
each style of version numbering).  There are currently two such classes
implemented: StrictVersion and LooseVersion.

Every version number class implements the following interface:
  * the 'parse' method takes a string and parses it to some internal
    representation; if the string is an invalid version number,
    'parse' raises a ValueError exception
  * the class constructor takes an optional string argument which,
    if supplied, is passed to 'parse'
  * __str__ reconstructs the string that was passed to 'parse' (or
    an equivalent string -- ie. one that will generate an equivalent
    version number instance)
  * __repr__ generates Python code to recreate the version number instance
  * _cmp compares the current instance with either another instance
    of the same class or a string (which will be parsed to an instance
    of the same class, thus must follow the same rules)
