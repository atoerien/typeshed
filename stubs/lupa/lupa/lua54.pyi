    The main entry point to the Lua runtime.

    Available options:

    * ``encoding``: the string encoding, defaulting to UTF-8.  If set
      to ``None``, all string values will be returned as byte strings.
      Otherwise, they will be decoded to unicode strings on the way
      from Lua to Python and unicode strings will be encoded on the
      way to Lua.  Note that ``str()`` calls on Lua objects will
      always return a unicode object.

    * ``source_encoding``: the encoding used for Lua code, defaulting to
      the string encoding or UTF-8 if the string encoding is ``None``.

    * ``attribute_filter``: filter function for attribute access
      (get/set).  Must have the signature ``func(obj, attr_name,
      is_setting)``, where ``is_setting`` is True when the attribute
      is being set.  If provided, the function will be called for all
      Python object attributes that are being accessed from Lua code.
      Normally, it should return an attribute name that will then be
      used for the lookup.  If it wants to prevent access, it should
      raise an ``AttributeError``.  Note that Lua does not guarantee
      that the names will be strings.  (New in Lupa 0.20)

    * ``attribute_handlers``: like ``attribute_filter`` above, but
      handles the getting/setting itself rather than giving hints
      to the LuaRuntime.  This must be a 2-tuple, ``(getter, setter)``
      where ``getter`` has the signature ``func(obj, attr_name)``
      and either returns the value for ``obj.attr_name`` or raises an
      ``AttributeError``  The function ``setter`` has the signature
      ``func(obj, attr_name, value)`` and may raise an ``AttributeError``.
      The return value of the setter is unused.  (New in Lupa 1.0)

    * ``register_eval``: should Python's ``eval()`` function be available
      to Lua code as ``python.eval()``?  Note that this does not remove it
      from the builtins.  Use an ``attribute_filter`` function for that.
      (default: True)

    * ``register_builtins``: should Python's builtins be available to Lua
      code as ``python.builtins.*``?  Note that this does not prevent access
      to the globals available as special Python function attributes, for
      example.  Use an ``attribute_filter`` function for that.
      (default: True, new in Lupa 1.2)

    * ``unpack_returned_tuples``: should Python tuples be unpacked in Lua?
      If ``py_fun()`` returns ``(1, 2, 3)``, then does ``a, b, c = py_fun()``
      give ``a == 1 and b == 2 and c == 3`` or does it give
      ``a == (1,2,3), b == nil, c == nil``?  ``unpack_returned_tuples=True``
      gives the former.
      (default: False, new in Lupa 0.21)

    * ``overflow_handler``: function for handling Python integers overflowing
      Lua integers. Must have the signature ``func(obj)``. If provided, the
      function will be called when a Python integer (possibly of arbitrary
      precision type) is too large to fit in a fixed-precision Lua integer.
      Normally, it should return the now well-behaved object that can be
      converted/wrapped to a Lua type. If the object cannot be precisely
      represented in Lua, it should raise an ``OverflowError``.

    * ``max_memory``: max memory usage this LuaRuntime can use in bytes.
      If max_memory is None, the default lua allocator is used and calls to
      ``set_max_memory(limit)`` will fail with a ``LuaMemoryError``.
      Note: Not supported on 64bit LuaJIT.
      (default: None, i.e. no limitation. New in Lupa 2.0)

    Example usage::

      >>> from lupa import LuaRuntime
      >>> lua = LuaRuntime()

      >>> lua.eval('1+1')
      2

      >>> lua_func = lua.eval('function(f, n) return f(n) end')
