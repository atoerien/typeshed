"""
Provides a tasklet decorator and related helpers.

Tasklets are a way to write concurrently running functions without threads.
Tasklets are executed by an event loop and can suspend themselves blocking for
I/O or some other operation using a yield statement. The notion of a blocking
operation is abstracted into the Future class, but a tasklet may also yield an
RPC in order to wait for that RPC to complete.

The @tasklet decorator wraps generator function so that when it is called, a
Future is returned while the generator is executed by the event loop. Within
the tasklet, any yield of a Future waits for and returns the Future's result.
For example::

    from from google.cloud.ndb.tasklets import tasklet

    @tasklet
    def foo():
        a = yield <AFuture>
        b = yield <BFuture>
        return a + b

    def main():
        f = foo()
        x = f.result()
        print(x)

In this example, `foo` needs the results of two futures, `AFuture` and
`BFuture`, which it gets somehow, for example as results of calls.
Rather than waiting for their values and blocking, it yields. First,
the tasklet yields `AFuture`.  The event loop gets `AFuture` and takes
care of waiting for its result.  When the event loop gets the result
of `AFuture`, it sends it to the tasklet by calling `send` on the
iterator returned by calling the tasklet.  The tasklet assigns the
value sent to `a` and then yields `BFuture`.  Again the event loop
waits for the result of `BFuture` and sends it to the tasklet.  The
tasklet then has what it needs to compute a result.

The tasklet simply returns its result. (Behind the scenes, when you
return a value from a generator in Python 3, a `StopIteration`
exception is raised with the return value as its argument. The event
loop catches the exception and uses the exception argument as the
result of the tasklet.)

Note that blocking until the Future's result is available using result() is
somewhat inefficient (though not vastly -- it is not busy-waiting). In most
cases such code should be rewritten as a tasklet instead::

    @tasklet
    def main_tasklet():
        f = foo()
        x = yield f
        print(x)

Calling a tasklet automatically schedules it with the event loop::

    def main():
        f = main_tasklet()
        eventloop.run()  # Run until no tasklets left to do
        f.done()  # Returns True
