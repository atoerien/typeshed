    """
    An iterator for query results.

    Executes the given query and provides an interface for iterating over
    instances of either :class:`model.Model` or :class:`key.Key` depending on
    whether ``keys_only`` was specified for the query.

    This is an abstract base class. Users should not instantiate an iterator
    class directly. Use :meth:`query.Query.iter` or ``iter(query)`` to get an
    instance of :class:`QueryIterator`.

        Is there at least one more result?

        Blocks until the answer to this question is known and buffers the
        result (if any) until retrieved with :meth:`next`.

        Returns:
            bool: :data:`True` if a subsequent call to
                :meth:`QueryIterator.next` will return a result, otherwise

        Like :meth:`has_next` but won't block.

        Datastore for the answer.

        May return a false positive (:data:`True` when :meth:`next` would
        actually raise ``StopIteration``), but never a false negative
        (:data:`False` when :meth:`next` would actually return a result).

        :meth:`has_next` or :meth:`has_next_async` which will buffer the next
        result.

    API for converting to/from a URL safe string is different depending on
    whether you're reading the Legacy NDB docstrings or the official Legacy NDB
    documentation on the web. We do both here.
