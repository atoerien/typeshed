A model class represents the structure of entities stored in the datastore.
Applications define model classes to indicate the structure of their entities,
then instantiate those model classes to create entities.

All model classes must inherit (directly or indirectly) from Model. Through
the magic of metaclasses, straightforward assignments in the model class
definition can be used to declare the model's structure::

    class Person(Model):
        name = StringProperty()
        age = IntegerProperty()

We can now create a Person entity and write it to Cloud Datastore::

    person = Person(name='Arthur Dent', age=42)
    key = person.put()

The return value from put() is a Key (see the documentation for
``ndb/key.py``), which can be used to retrieve the same entity later::

    person2 = key.get()
    person2 == person  # Returns True

To update an entity, simply change its attributes and write it back (note that
this doesn't change the key)::

    person2.name = 'Arthur Philip Dent'
    person2.put()

We can also delete an entity (by using the key)::

    key.delete()

The property definitions in the class body tell the system the names and the
types of the fields to be stored in Cloud Datastore, whether they must be
indexed, their default value, and more.

Many different Property types exist.  Most are indexed by default, the
exceptions are indicated in the list below:

- :class:`StringProperty`: a short text string, limited to at most 1500 bytes
  (when UTF-8 encoded from :class:`str` to bytes).
- :class:`TextProperty`: an unlimited text string; unindexed.
- :class:`BlobProperty`: an unlimited byte string; unindexed.
- :class:`IntegerProperty`: a 64-bit signed integer.
- :class:`FloatProperty`: a double precision floating point number.
- :class:`BooleanProperty`: a bool value.
- :class:`DateTimeProperty`: a datetime object. Note: Datastore always uses
  UTC as the timezone.
- :class:`DateProperty`: a date object.
- :class:`TimeProperty`: a time object.
- :class:`GeoPtProperty`: a geographical location, i.e. (latitude, longitude).
- :class:`KeyProperty`: a Cloud Datastore Key value, optionally constrained to
  referring to a specific kind.
- :class:`UserProperty`: a User object (for backwards compatibility only)
- :class:`StructuredProperty`: a field that is itself structured like an
  entity; see below for more details.
- :class:`LocalStructuredProperty`: like StructuredProperty but the on-disk
  representation is an opaque blob; unindexed.
- :class:`ComputedProperty`: a property whose value is computed from other
  properties by a user-defined function. The property value is written to Cloud
  Datastore so that it can be used in queries, but the value from Cloud
  Datastore is not used when the entity is read back.
- :class:`GenericProperty`: a property whose type is not constrained; mostly
  used by the Expando class (see below) but also usable explicitly.
- :class:`JsonProperty`: a property whose value is any object that can be
  serialized using JSON; the value written to Cloud Datastore is a JSON
  representation of that object.
- :class:`PickleProperty`: a property whose value is any object that can be
  serialized using Python's pickle protocol; the value written to the Cloud
  Datastore is the pickled representation of that object, using the highest
  available pickle protocol

Most Property classes have similar constructor signatures.  They
accept several optional keyword arguments:

- name=<string>: the name used to store the property value in the datastore.
  Unlike the following options, this may also be given as a positional
  argument.
- indexed=<bool>: indicates whether the property should be indexed (allowing
  queries on this property's value).
- repeated=<bool>: indicates that this property can have multiple values in
  the same entity.
- write_empty_list<bool>: For repeated value properties, controls whether
  properties with no elements (the empty list) is written to Datastore. If
  true, written, if false, then nothing is written to Datastore.
- required=<bool>: indicates that this property must be given a value.
- default=<value>: a default value if no explicit value is given.
- choices=<list of values>: a list or tuple of allowable values.
- validator=<function>: a general-purpose validation function. It will be
  called with two arguments (prop, value) and should either return the
  validated value or raise an exception. It is also allowed for the function
  to modify the value, but the function should be idempotent. For example: a
  validator that returns value.strip() or value.lower() is fine, but one that
  returns value + '$' is not).
- verbose_name=<value>: A human readable name for this property. This human
  readable name can be used for html form labels.

The repeated and required/default options are mutually exclusive: a repeated
property cannot be required nor can it specify a default value (the default is
always an empty list and an empty list is always an allowed value), but a
required property can have a default.

Some property types have additional arguments.  Some property types do not
support all options.

Repeated properties are always represented as Python lists; if there is only
one value, the list has only one element. When a new list is assigned to a
repeated property, all elements of the list are validated. Since it is also
possible to mutate lists in place, repeated properties are re-validated before
they are written to the datastore.

No validation happens when an entity is read from Cloud Datastore; however
property values read that have the wrong type (e.g. a string value for an
IntegerProperty) are ignored.

For non-repeated properties, None is always a possible value, and no validation
is called when the value is set to None. However for required properties,
writing the entity to Cloud Datastore requires the value to be something other
than None (and valid).

The StructuredProperty is different from most other properties; it lets you
define a sub-structure for your entities. The substructure itself is defined
using a model class, and the attribute value is an instance of that model
class. However, it is not stored in the datastore as a separate entity;
instead, its attribute values are included in the parent entity using a naming
convention (the name of the structured attribute followed by a dot followed by
the name of the subattribute). For example::

    class Address(Model):
      street = StringProperty()
      city = StringProperty()

    class Person(Model):
      name = StringProperty()
      address = StructuredProperty(Address)

    p = Person(name='Harry Potter',
               address=Address(street='4 Privet Drive',
               city='Little Whinging'))
    k = p.put()

This would write a single 'Person' entity with three attributes (as you could
verify using the Datastore Viewer in the Admin Console)::

    name = 'Harry Potter'
    address.street = '4 Privet Drive'
    address.city = 'Little Whinging'

Structured property types can be nested arbitrarily deep, but in a hierarchy of
nested structured property types, only one level can have the repeated flag
set. It is fine to have multiple structured properties referencing the same
model class.

It is also fine to use the same model class both as a top-level entity class
and as for a structured property; however, queries for the model class will
only return the top-level entities.

The LocalStructuredProperty works similar to StructuredProperty on the Python
side. For example::

    class Address(Model):
        street = StringProperty()
        city = StringProperty()

    class Person(Model):
        name = StringProperty()
        address = LocalStructuredProperty(Address)

    p = Person(name='Harry Potter',
               address=Address(street='4 Privet Drive',
               city='Little Whinging'))
    k = p.put()

However, the data written to Cloud Datastore is different; it writes a 'Person'
entity with a 'name' attribute as before and a single 'address' attribute
whose value is a blob which encodes the Address value (using the standard
"protocol buffer" encoding).

The Model class offers basic query support. You can create a Query object by
calling the query() class method. Iterating over a Query object returns the
entities matching the query one at a time. Query objects are fully described
in the documentation for query, but there is one handy shortcut that is only
available through Model.query(): positional arguments are interpreted as filter
expressions which are combined through an AND operator. For example::

    Person.query(Person.name == 'Harry Potter', Person.age >= 11)

is equivalent to::

    Person.query().filter(Person.name == 'Harry Potter', Person.age >= 11)

Keyword arguments passed to .query() are passed along to the Query()
constructor.

It is possible to query for field values of structured properties. For
example::

    qry = Person.query(Person.address.city == 'London')

A number of top-level functions also live in this module:

- :func:`get_multi` reads multiple entities at once.
- :func:`put_multi` writes multiple entities at once.
- :func:`delete_multi` deletes multiple entities at once.

All these have a corresponding ``*_async()`` variant as well. The
``*_multi_async()`` functions return a list of Futures.

There are many other interesting features. For example, Model subclasses may
define pre-call and post-call hooks for most operations (get, put, delete,
allocate_ids), and Property classes may be subclassed to suit various needs.
Documentation for writing a Property subclass is in the docs for the
:class:`Property` class.

class Property(ModelAttribute):
    """
    A class describing a typed, persisted attribute of an entity.

    .. warning::

        This is not to be confused with Python's ``@property`` built-in.

    .. note::

        This is just a base class; there are specific subclasses that
        describe properties of various types (and :class:`GenericProperty`
        which describes a dynamically typed property).

    The :class:`Property` does not reserve any "public" names (i.e. names
    that don't start with an underscore). This is intentional; the subclass
    :class:`StructuredProperty` uses the public attribute namespace to refer to
    nested property names (this is essential for specifying queries on
    subproperties).

    The :meth:`IN` attribute is provided as an alias for ``_IN``, but ``IN``
    can be overridden if a subproperty has the same name.

    The :class:`Property` class and its predefined subclasses allow easy
    subclassing using composable (or stackable) validation and
    conversion APIs. These require some terminology definitions:

    * A **user value** is a value such as would be set and accessed by the
      application code using standard attributes on the entity.
    * A **base value** is a value such as would be serialized to
      and deserialized from Cloud Datastore.

    A property will be a member of a :class:`Model` and will be used to help
    store values in an ``entity`` (i.e. instance of a model subclass). The
    underlying stored values can be either user values or base values.

    To interact with the composable conversion and validation API, a
    :class:`Property` subclass can define

    * ``_to_base_type()``
    * ``_from_base_type()``
    * ``_validate()``

    These should **not** call their ``super()`` method, since the methods
    are meant to be composed. For example with composable validation:

    .. code-block:: python

        class Positive(ndb.IntegerProperty):
            def _validate(self, value):
                if value < 1:
                    raise ndb.exceptions.BadValueError("Non-positive", value)


        class SingleDigit(Positive):
            def _validate(self, value):
                if value > 9:
                    raise ndb.exceptions.BadValueError("Multi-digit", value)

    neither ``_validate()`` method calls ``super()``. Instead, when a
    ``SingleDigit`` property validates a value, it composes all validation
    calls in order:

    * ``SingleDigit._validate``
    * ``Positive._validate``
    * ``IntegerProperty._validate``

    The API supports "stacking" classes with ever more sophisticated
    user / base conversions:

    * the user to base conversion goes from more sophisticated to less
      sophisticated
    * the base to user conversion goes from less sophisticated to more
      sophisticated

    For example, see the relationship between :class:`BlobProperty`,
    :class:`TextProperty` and :class:`StringProperty`.

    The validation API distinguishes between "lax" and "strict" user values.
    The set of lax values is a superset of the set of strict values. The
    ``_validate()`` method takes a lax value and if necessary converts it to
    a strict value. For example, an integer (lax) can be converted to a
    floating point (strict) value. This means that when setting the property
    value, lax values are accepted, while when getting the property value, only
    strict values will be returned. If no conversion is needed, ``_validate()``
    may return :data:`None`. If the argument is outside the set of accepted lax
    values, ``_validate()`` should raise an exception, preferably
    :exc:`TypeError` or :exc:`.BadValueError`.

    A class utilizing all three may resemble:

    .. code-block:: python

        class WidgetProperty(ndb.Property):

            def _validate(self, value):
                # Lax user value to strict user value.
                if not isinstance(value, Widget):
                    raise ndb.exceptions.BadValueError(value)

            def _to_base_type(self, value):
                # (Strict) user value to base value.
                if isinstance(value, Widget):
                    return value.to_internal()

            def _from_base_type(self, value):
                # Base value to (strict) user value.'
                if not isinstance(value, _WidgetInternal):
                    return Widget(value)

    There are some things that ``_validate()``, ``_to_base_type()`` and
    ``_from_base_type()`` do **not** need to handle:

    * :data:`None`: They will not be called with :data:`None` (and if they
      return :data:`None`, this means that the value does not need conversion).
    * Repeated values: The infrastructure takes care of calling
      ``_from_base_type()`` or ``_to_base_type()`` for each list item in a
      repeated value.
    * Wrapping "base" values: The wrapping and unwrapping is taken care of by
      the infrastructure that calls the composable APIs.
    * Comparisons: The comparison operations call ``_to_base_type()`` on
      their operand.
    * Distinguishing between user and base values: the infrastructure
      guarantees that ``_from_base_type()`` will be called with an
      (unwrapped) base value, and that ``_to_base_type()`` will be called
      with a user value.
    * Returning the original value: if any of these return :data:`None`, the
      original value is kept. (Returning a different value not equal to
      :data:`None` will substitute the different value.)

    Additionally, :meth:`_prepare_for_put` can be used to integrate with
    datastore save hooks used by :class:`Model` instances.

class DateTimeProperty(Property):
    """
    A property that contains :class:`~datetime.datetime` values.

    If ``tzinfo`` is not set, this property expects "naive" datetime stamps,
    i.e. no timezone can be set. Furthermore, the assumption is that naive
    datetime stamps represent UTC.

    If ``tzinfo`` is set, timestamps will be stored as UTC and converted back
    to the timezone set by ``tzinfo`` when reading values back out.

    .. note::

        Unlike Django, ``auto_now_add`` can be overridden by setting the
        value before writing the entity. And unlike the legacy
        ``google.appengine.ext.db``, ``auto_now`` does not supply a default
        value. Also unlike legacy ``db``, when the entity is written, the
        property values are updated to match what was written. Finally, beware
        that this also updates the value in the in-process cache, **and** that
        ``auto_now_add`` may interact weirdly with transaction retries (a retry
        of a property with ``auto_now_add`` set will reuse the value that was
        set on the first try).

class Model(_NotEqualMixin, metaclass=MetaModel):
    """
    A class describing Cloud Datastore entities.

    Model instances are usually called entities. All model classes
    inheriting from :class:`Model` automatically have :class:`MetaModel` as
    their metaclass, so that the properties are fixed up properly after the
    class is defined.

    Because of this, you cannot use the same :class:`Property` object to
    describe multiple properties -- you must create separate :class:`Property`
    objects for each property. For example, this does not work:

    .. code-block:: python

        reuse_prop = ndb.StringProperty()

        class Wrong(ndb.Model):
            first = reuse_prop
            second = reuse_prop

    instead each class attribute needs to be distinct:

    .. code-block:: python

        class NotWrong(ndb.Model):
            first = ndb.StringProperty()
            second = ndb.StringProperty()

    The "kind" for a given :class:`Model` subclass is normally equal to the
    class name (exclusive of the module name or any other parent scope). To
    override the kind, define :meth:`_get_kind`, as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyModel(ndb.Model):
            @classmethod
            def _get_kind(cls):
                return "AnotherKind"

    A newly constructed entity will not be persisted to Cloud Datastore without
    an explicit call to :meth:`put`.

    User-defined properties can be passed to the constructor via keyword
    arguments:

    .. doctest:: model-keywords

        >>> class MyModel(ndb.Model):
        ...     value = ndb.FloatProperty()
        ...     description = ndb.StringProperty()
        ...
        >>> MyModel(value=7.34e22, description="Mass of the moon")
        MyModel(description='Mass of the moon', value=7.34e+22)

    In addition to user-defined properties, there are seven accepted keyword
    arguments:

    * ``key``
    * ``id``
    * ``app``
    * ``namespace``
    * ``database``
    * ``parent``
    * ``projection``

    Of these, ``key`` is a public attribute on :class:`Model` instances:

    .. testsetup:: model-key

        from google.cloud import ndb


        class MyModel(ndb.Model):
            value = ndb.FloatProperty()
            description = ndb.StringProperty()

    .. doctest:: model-key

        >>> entity1 = MyModel(id=11)
        >>> entity1.key
        Key('MyModel', 11)
        >>> entity2 = MyModel(parent=entity1.key)
        >>> entity2.key
        Key('MyModel', 11, 'MyModel', None)
        >>> entity3 = MyModel(key=ndb.Key(MyModel, "e-three"))
        >>> entity3.key
        Key('MyModel', 'e-three')

    However, a user-defined property can be defined on the model with the
    same name as one of those keyword arguments. In this case, the user-defined
    property "wins":

    .. doctest:: model-keyword-id-collision

        >>> class IDCollide(ndb.Model):
        ...     id = ndb.FloatProperty()
        ...
        >>> entity = IDCollide(id=17)
        >>> entity
        IDCollide(id=17.0)
        >>> entity.key is None
        True

    In such cases of argument "collision", an underscore can be used as a
    keyword argument prefix:

    .. doctest:: model-keyword-id-collision

        >>> entity = IDCollide(id=17, _id=2009)
        >>> entity
        IDCollide(key=Key('IDCollide', 2009), id=17.0)

    For the **very** special case of a property named ``key``, the ``key``
    attribute will no longer be the entity's key but instead will be the
    property value. Instead, the entity's key is accessible via ``_key``:

    .. doctest:: model-keyword-key-collision

        >>> class KeyCollide(ndb.Model):
        ...     key = ndb.StringProperty()
        ...
        >>> entity1 = KeyCollide(key="Take fork in road", id=987)
        >>> entity1
        KeyCollide(_key=Key('KeyCollide', 987), key='Take fork in road')
        >>> entity1.key
        'Take fork in road'
        >>> entity1._key
        Key('KeyCollide', 987)
        >>>
        >>> entity2 = KeyCollide(key="Go slow", _key=ndb.Key(KeyCollide, 1))
        >>> entity2
        KeyCollide(_key=Key('KeyCollide', 1), key='Go slow')

    The constructor accepts keyword arguments based on the properties
    defined on model subclass. However, using keywords for nonexistent
    or non-:class:`Property` class attributes will cause a failure:

    .. doctest:: model-keywords-fail

        >>> class Simple(ndb.Model):
        ...     marker = 1001
        ...     some_name = ndb.StringProperty()
        ...

        TypeError: Cannot set non-property marker
        >>> Simple(some_name="Value set here.", missing=29)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          ...
        AttributeError: type object 'Simple' has no attribute 'missing'
