"""
High-level wrapper for datastore queries.

The fundamental API here overloads the 6 comparison operators to represent
filters on property values, and supports AND and OR operations (implemented as
functions -- Python's 'and' and 'or' operators cannot be overloaded, and the
'&' and '|' operators have a priority that conflicts with the priority of
comparison operators).

For example::

    class Employee(Model):
        name = StringProperty()
        age = IntegerProperty()
        rank = IntegerProperty()

      @classmethod
      def demographic(cls, min_age, max_age):
          return cls.query().filter(AND(cls.age >= min_age,
                                        cls.age <= max_age))

      @classmethod
      def ranked(cls, rank):
          return cls.query(cls.rank == rank).order(cls.age)

    for emp in Employee.seniors(42, 5):
        print(emp.name, emp.age, emp.rank)

The 'in' operator cannot be overloaded, but is supported through the IN()
method. For example::

    Employee.query().filter(Employee.rank.IN([4, 5, 6]))

Sort orders are supported through the order() method; unary minus is
overloaded on the Property class to represent a descending order::

    Employee.query().order(Employee.name, -Employee.age)

Besides using AND() and OR(), filters can also be combined by repeatedly
calling .filter()::

    query1 = Employee.query()  # A query that returns all employees
    query2 = query1.filter(Employee.age >= 30)  # Only those over 30
    query3 = query2.filter(Employee.age < 40)  # Only those in their 30s

A further shortcut is calling .filter() with multiple arguments; this implies
AND()::

  query1 = Employee.query()  # A query that returns all employees
  query3 = query1.filter(Employee.age >= 30,
                         Employee.age < 40)  # Only those in their 30s

And finally you can also pass one or more filter expressions directly to the
.query() method::

  query3 = Employee.query(Employee.age >= 30,
                          Employee.age < 40)  # Only those in their 30s

Query objects are immutable, so these methods always return a new Query object;
the above calls to filter() do not affect query1. On the other hand, operations
that are effectively no-ops may return the original Query object.

Sort orders can also be combined this way, and .filter() and .order() calls may
be intermixed::

    query4 = query3.order(-Employee.age)
    query5 = query4.order(Employee.name)
    query6 = query5.filter(Employee.rank == 5)

Again, multiple .order() calls can be combined::

    query5 = query3.order(-Employee.age, Employee.name)

The simplest way to retrieve Query results is a for-loop::

    for emp in query3:
        print emp.name, emp.age

Some other methods to run a query and access its results::

    :meth:`Query.iter`() # Return an iterator; same as iter(q) but more
        flexible.
    :meth:`Query.fetch`(N) # Return a list of the first N results
    :meth:`Query.get`() # Return the first result
    :meth:`Query.count`(N) # Return the number of results, with a maximum of N
    :meth:`Query.fetch_page`(N, start_cursor=cursor) # Return (results, cursor,
        has_more)

All of the above methods take a standard set of additional query options,
in the form of keyword arguments such as keys_only=True. You can also pass
a QueryOptions object options=QueryOptions(...), but this is deprecated.

The most important query options are:

- keys_only: bool, if set the results are keys instead of entities.
- limit: int, limits the number of results returned.
- offset: int, skips this many results first.
- start_cursor: Cursor, start returning results after this position.
- end_cursor: Cursor, stop returning results after this position.

The following query options have been deprecated or are not supported in
datastore queries:

- batch_size: int, hint for the number of results returned per RPC.
- prefetch_size: int, hint for the number of results in the first RPC.
- produce_cursors: bool, return Cursor objects with the results.

All of the above methods except for iter() have asynchronous variants as well,
which return a Future; to get the operation's ultimate result, yield the Future
(when inside a tasklet) or call the Future's get_result() method (outside a
tasklet)::

    :meth:`Query.fetch_async`(N)
    :meth:`Query.get_async`()
    :meth:`Query.count_async`(N)
    :meth:`Query.fetch_page_async`(N, start_cursor=cursor)

Finally, there's an idiom to efficiently loop over the Query results in a
tasklet, properly yielding when appropriate::

    it = query1.iter()
    while (yield it.has_next_async()):
        emp = it.next()
        print(emp.name, emp.age)

            The legacy GAE version of NDB claims this is more efficient than

            network traffic, making this call really equivalent to
            ``len(q.fetch(limit, keys_only=True))``. We can also avoid
            marshalling NDB key objects from the returned protocol buffers, but
            this is a minor savings--most applications that use NDB will have
            their performance bound by the Datastore backend, not the CPU.
