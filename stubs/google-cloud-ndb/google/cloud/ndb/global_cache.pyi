class GlobalCache(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """
    Abstract base class for a global entity cache.

    A global entity cache is shared across contexts, sessions, and possibly
    even servers. A concrete implementation is available which uses Redis.

    Essentially, this class models a simple key/value store where keys and
    values are arbitrary ``bytes`` instances. "Compare and swap", aka
    "optimistic transactions" should also be supported.

    Concrete implementations can either by synchronous or asynchronous.
    Asynchronous implementations should return
    :class:`~google.cloud.ndb.tasklets.Future` instances whose eventual results
    match the return value described for each method. Because coordinating with
    the single threaded event model used by ``NDB`` can be tricky with remote
    services, it's not recommended that casual users write asynchronous
    implementations, as some specialized knowledge is required.

    Attributes:
        strict_read (bool): If :data:`False`, transient errors that occur as part of a
            entity lookup operation will be logged as warnings but not raised to the
            application layer. If :data:`True`, in the event of transient errors, cache
            operations will be retried a number of times before eventually raising the
            transient error to the application layer, if it does not resolve after
            retrying. Setting this to :data:`True` will cause NDB operations to take
            longer to complete if there are transient errors in the cache layer.
        strict_write (bool): If :data:`False`, transient errors that occur as part of
            a put or delete operation will be logged as warnings, but not raised to the
            application layer. If :data:`True`, in the event of transient errors, cache
            operations will be retried a number of times before eventually raising the
            transient error to the application layer if it does not resolve after
            retrying. Setting this to :data:`False` somewhat increases the risk
            that other clients might read stale data from the cache. Setting this to
            :data:`True` will cause NDB operations to take longer to complete if there
            are transient errors in the cache layer.
