"""
Pure python code for finding unused ports on a host.

This module provides a pick_unused_port() function.
It can also be called via the command line for use in shell scripts.
When called from the command line, it takes one optional argument, which,
if given, is sent to portserver instead of portpicker's PID.
To reserve a port for the lifetime of a bash script, use $BASHPID as this
argument.

There is a race condition between picking a port and your application code
binding to it.  The use of a port server to prevent that is recommended on
loaded test hosts running many tests at a time.

If your code can accept a bound socket as input rather than being handed a
port number consider using socket.bind(('localhost', 0)) to bind to an
available port without a race condition rather than using this library.

Typical usage:
  test_port = portpicker.pick_unused_port()

    Try to bind to a socket of the specified type, protocol, and port.

    This is primarily a helper function for PickUnusedPort, used to see
    if a particular port number is available.

    For the port to be considered available, the kernel must support at least
    one of (IPv6, IPv4), and the port must be available on each supported
    family.

    Args:
      port: The port number to bind to, or 0 to have the OS pick a free port.
      socket_type: The type of the socket (ex: socket.SOCK_STREAM).
      socket_proto: The protocol of the socket (ex: socket.IPPROTO_TCP).

    Returns:
      The port number on success or None on failure.

    Picks an unused port and reserves it for use by a given process id.

    Args:
      pid: PID to tell the portserver to associate the reservation with. If
        None, the current process's PID is used.
      portserver_address: The address (path) of a unix domain socket
        with which to connect to a portserver, a leading '@'
        character indicates an address in the "abstract namespace".  OR
        On systems without socket.AF_UNIX, this is an AF_INET address.
        If None, or no port is returned by the portserver at the provided
        address, the environment will be checked for a PORTSERVER_ADDRESS
        variable.  If that is not set, no port server will be used.

    If no portserver is used, no pid based reservation is managed by any
    central authority. Race conditions and duplicate assignments may occur.

      A port number that is unused on both TCP and UDP.

    Request a free a port from a system-wide portserver.

    This follows a very simple portserver protocol:

    This function is an implementation detail of pick_unused_port().
    It should not normally be called by code outside of this module.
