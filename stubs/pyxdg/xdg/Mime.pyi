"""
This module is based on a rox module (LGPL):

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/rox/ROX-Lib2/python/rox/mime.py?rev=1.21&view=log

This module provides access to the shared MIME database.

types is a dictionary of all known MIME types, indexed by the type name, e.g.
types['application/x-python']

Applications can install information about MIME types by storing an
XML file as <MIME>/packages/<application>.xml and running the
update-mime-database command, which is provided by the freedesktop.org
shared mime database package.

See http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info-spec/ for
information about the format of these files.
