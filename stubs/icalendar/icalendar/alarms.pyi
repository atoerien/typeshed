Compute the times and states of alarms.

This takes different calendar software into account and the RFC 9074 (Alarm Extension).

- RFC 9074 defines an ACKNOWLEDGED property in the VALARM.
- Outlook does not export VALARM information.
- Google Calendar uses the DTSTAMP to acknowledge the alarms.
- Thunderbird snoozes the alarms with a X-MOZ-SNOOZE-TIME attribute in the event.
- Thunderbird acknowledges the alarms with a X-MOZ-LASTACK attribute in the event.
- Etar deletes alarms that are acknowledged.
- Nextcloud's Webinterface does not do anything with the alarms when the time passes.
