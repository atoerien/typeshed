    This transform generates a table of contents from the entire document tree

    contents directive.  A title is either explicitly specified, taken from
    the appropriate language module, or omitted (local table of contents).
    The depth may be specified.  Two-way references between the table of
    contents and section titles are generated (requires Writer support).

    This transform requires a startnode, which contains generation
    options and provides the location for the generated table of contents (the
    startnode is replaced by the table of contents "topic").
