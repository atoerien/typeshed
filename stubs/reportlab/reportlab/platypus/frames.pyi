    A Frame is a piece of space in a document that is filled by the
    "flowables" in the story.  For example in a book like document most
    pages have the text paragraphs in one or two frames.  For generality
    a page might have several frames (for example for 3 column text or
    for text that wraps around a graphic).

    After creation a Frame is not usually manipulated directly by the
    applications program -- it is used internally by the platypus modules.

    Here is a diagramatid abstraction for the definitional part of a Frame::
