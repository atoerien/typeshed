"""
A flowable is a "floating element" in a document whose exact position is determined by the
other elements that precede it, such as a paragraph, a diagram interspersed between paragraphs,
a section header, etcetera.  Examples of non-flowables include page numbering annotations,
headers, footers, fixed diagrams or logos, among others.

Flowables are defined here as objects which know how to determine their size and which
can draw themselves onto a page with respect to a relative "origin" position determined
at a higher level. The object's draw() method should assume that (0,0) corresponds to the
bottom left corner of the enclosing rectangle that will contain the object. The attributes
vAlign and hAlign may be used by 'packers' as hints as to how the object should be placed.

Some Flowables also know how to "split themselves".  For example a
long paragraph might split itself between one page and the next.

Packers should set the canv attribute during wrap, split & draw operations to allow
the flowable to work out sizes etc in the proper context.

The "text" of a document usually consists mainly of a sequence of flowables which
flow into a document from top to bottom (with column and page breaks controlled by
higher level components).
