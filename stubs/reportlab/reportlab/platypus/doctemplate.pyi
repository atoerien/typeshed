"""
This module contains the core structure of platypus.

rlatypus constructs documents.  Document styles are determined by DocumentTemplates.

Each DocumentTemplate contains one or more PageTemplates which defines the look of the
pages of the document.

Each PageTemplate has a procedure for drawing the "non-flowing" part of the page
(for example the header, footer, page number, fixed logo graphic, watermark, etcetera) and
a set of Frames which enclose the flowing part of the page (for example the paragraphs,
tables, or non-fixed diagrams of the text).

A document is built when a DocumentTemplate is fed a sequence of Flowables.
The action of the build consumes the flowables in order and places them onto
frames on pages as space allows.  When a frame runs out of space the next frame
of the page is used.  If no frame remains a new page is created.  A new page
can also be created if a page break is forced.

The special invisible flowable NextPageTemplate can be used to specify
the page template for the next page (which by default is the one being used
for the current frame).

class BaseDocTemplate:
    """
    First attempt at defining a document template class.

    The basic idea is simple.

    1)  The document has a list of data associated with it
        this data should derive from flowables. We'll have
        special classes like PageBreak, FrameBreak to do things
        like forcing a page end etc.

    2)  The document has one or more page templates.

    3)  Each page template has one or more frames.

    4)  The document class provides base methods for handling the
        story events and some reasonable methods for getting the
        story flowables into the frames.

    5)  The document instances can override the base handler routines.

    Most of the methods for this class are not called directly by the user,
    but in some advanced usages they may need to be overridden via subclassing.

    EXCEPTION: doctemplate.build(...) must be called for most reasonable uses
    since it builds a document using the page template.

    Each document template builds exactly one document into a file specified
    by the filename argument on initialization.

    Possible keyword arguments for the initialization:

    - pageTemplates: A list of templates.  Must be nonempty.  Names
      assigned to the templates are used for referring to them so no two used
      templates should have the same name.  For example you might want one template
      for a title page, one for a section first page, one for a first page of
      a chapter and two more for the interior of a chapter on odd and even pages.
      If this argument is omitted then at least one pageTemplate should be provided
      using the addPageTemplates method before the document is built.
    - pageSize: a 2-tuple or a size constant from reportlab/lib/pagesizes.pu.
      Used by the SimpleDocTemplate subclass which does NOT accept a list of
      pageTemplates but makes one for you; ignored when using pageTemplates.

    - showBoundary: if set draw a box around the frame boundaries.
    - leftMargin:
    - rightMargin:
    - topMargin:
    - bottomMargin:  Margin sizes in points (default 1 inch).  These margins may be
      overridden by the pageTemplates.  They are primarily of interest for the
      SimpleDocumentTemplate subclass.

    - allowSplitting:  If set flowables (eg, paragraphs) may be split across frames or pages
      (default: 1)
    - title: Internal title for document (does not automatically display on any page)
    - author: Internal author for document (does not automatically display on any page)
