"""
Utilities to associate bold and italic versions of fonts into families

Bold, italic and plain fonts are usually implemented in separate disk files;
but non-trivial apps want <b>this</b> to do the right thing.   We therefore
need to keep 'mappings' between the font family name and the right group
of up to 4 implementation fonts to use.

Most font-handling code lives in pdfbase, and this probably should too.
