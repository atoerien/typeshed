    Options that may be passed to constructor:

        value (int, or numeric string. required.):
            The value to encode.

        barWidth (float, default .0075):
            X-Dimension, or width of the smallest element
            Minumum is .0075 inch (7.5 mils).
        
        barHeight (float, see default below):
            Height of the symbol.  Default is the height of the two

            Default is the greater of .25 inch, or 10 barWidth
        
        rquiet (float, defaults as above):
            Quiet zone size to right left of code, if quiet is true.

        stop (bool, default 1):
