"""
This file is a collection of flag graphics as widgets.

All flags are represented at the ratio of 1:2, even where the official ratio for the flag is something else
(such as 3:5 for the German national flag). The only exceptions are for where this would look _very_ wrong,
such as the Danish flag whose (ratio is 28:37), or the Swiss flag (which is square).

Unless otherwise stated, these flags are all the 'national flags' of the countries, rather than their
state flags, naval flags, ensigns or any other variants. (National flags are the flag flown by civilians
of a country and the ones usually used to represent a country abroad. State flags are the variants used by
the government and by diplomatic missions overseas).

To check on how close these are to the 'official' representations of flags, check the World Flag Database at
http://www.flags.ndirect.co.uk/

The flags this file contains are:

EU Members:
United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
Holland (The Netherlands), Spain, Sweden

Others:
USA, Czech Republic, European Union, Switzerland, Turkey, Brazil
