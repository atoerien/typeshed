"""
Collection of axes for charts.

The current collection comprises axes for charts using cartesian
coordinate systems. All axes might have tick marks and labels.
There are two dichotomies for axes: one of X and Y flavours and
another of category and value flavours.

Category axes have an ordering but no metric. They are divided
into a number of equal-sized buckets. Their tick marks or labels,
if available, go BETWEEN the buckets, and the labels are placed
below to/left of the X/Y-axis, respectively.

  Value axes have an ordering AND metric. They correspond to a nu-
  meric quantity. Value axis have a real number quantity associated
  with it. The chart tells it where to go.
  The most basic axis divides the number line into equal spaces
  and has tickmarks and labels associated with each; later we
  will add variants where you can specify the sampling
  interval.

The charts using axis tell them where the labels should be placed.

Axes of complementary X/Y flavours can be connected to each other
in various ways, i.e. with a specific reference point, like an
x/value axis to a y/value (or category) axis. In this case the
connection can be either at the top or bottom of the former or
at any absolute value (specified in points) or at some value of
the former axes in its own coordinate system.
