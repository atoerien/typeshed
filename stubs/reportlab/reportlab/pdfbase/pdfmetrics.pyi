"""
This provides a database of font metric information and
efines Font, Encoding and TypeFace classes aimed at end users.

There are counterparts to some of these in pdfbase/pdfdoc.py, but
the latter focus on constructing the right PDF objects.  These
classes are declarative and focus on letting the user construct
and query font objects.

The module maintains a registry of font objects at run time.

It is independent of the canvas or any particular context.  It keeps
a registry of Font, TypeFace and Encoding objects.  Ideally these
would be pre-loaded, but due to a nasty circularity problem we
trap attempts to access them and do it on first access.
