    Represents a graphic path.  There are certain 'modes' to PDF
    drawing, and making a separate object to expose Path operations
    ensures they are completed with no run-time overhead.  Ask
    the Canvas for a PDFPath with getNewPathObject(); moveto/lineto/
    curveto wherever you want; add whole shapes; and then add it back
    into the canvas with one of the relevant operators.

    Path objects are probably not long, so we pack onto one line

    the code argument allows a canvas to get the operations appended directly so

        Draw a partial ellipse inscribed within the rectangle x1,y1,x2,y2,
