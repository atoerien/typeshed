        The "sub" (subject) claim identifies the principal that is the

        about the subject.  The subject value MUST either be scoped to be
        locally unique in the context of the issuer or be globally unique.

        The "aud" (audience) claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is
        intended for.  Each principal intended to process the JWT MUST
        identify itself with a value in the audience claim.  If the principal
        processing the claim does not identify itself with a value in the
        "aud" claim when this claim is present, then the JWT MUST be
        rejected.  In the general case, the "aud" value is an array of case-
        sensitive strings, each containing a StringOrURI value.  In the
        special case when the JWT has one audience, the "aud" value MAY be a
        single case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value.  The
        interpretation of audience values is generally application specific.

        processing of the "exp" claim requires that the current date/time
        MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the "exp" claim.
        Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than
        a few minutes, to account for clock skew.  Its value MUST be a number

        there is a negligible probability that the same value will be
        accidentally assigned to a different data object; if the application
        uses multiple issuers, collisions MUST be prevented among values
        produced by different issuers as well.  The "jti" claim can be used
