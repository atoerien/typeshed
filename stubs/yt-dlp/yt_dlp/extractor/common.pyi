class InfoExtractor:
    """
    Information Extractor class.

    Information extractors are the classes that, given a URL, extract
    information about the video (or videos) the URL refers to. This
    information includes the real video URL, the video title, author and
    others. The information is stored in a dictionary which is then
    passed to the YoutubeDL. The YoutubeDL processes this
    information possibly downloading the video to the file system, among
    other possible outcomes.

    The type field determines the type of the result.
    By far the most common value (and the default if _type is missing) is
    "video", which indicates a single video.

    For a video, the dictionaries must include the following fields:

    id:             Video identifier.
    title:          Video title, unescaped. Set to an empty string if video has
                    no title as opposed to "None" which signifies that the
                    extractor failed to obtain a title

    Additionally, it must contain either a formats entry or a url one:

    formats:        A list of dictionaries for each format available, ordered
                    from worst to best quality.

                    Potential fields:
                    * url        The mandatory URL representing the media:

                                       unfragmented media)
                                     - URL of the MPD manifest or base URL
                                       representing the media if MPD manifest
                                       is parsed from a string (in case of
                                       fragmented media)
                                   for MSS - URL of the ISM manifest.

                        * "start_time" - The start time of the chapter in seconds
                        * "end_time" - The end time of the chapter in seconds
                                       (optional: core code can determine this value from

                    must return a dict which will be added to the info_dict.
                    This is useful for additional information that is
                    time-consuming to extract. Note that the fields thus
                    extracted will not be available to output template and
                    match_filter. So, only "comments" and "comment_count" are
                    currently allowed to be extracted via this method.

    The following fields should only be used when the video belongs to some logical
    chapter or section:

    chapter:        Name or title of the chapter the video belongs to.
    chapter_number: Number of the chapter the video belongs to, as an integer.
    chapter_id:     Id of the chapter the video belongs to, as a unicode string.

    The following fields should only be used when the video is an episode of some
    series, programme or podcast:

    series:         Title of the series or programme the video episode belongs to.
    series_id:      Id of the series or programme the video episode belongs to, as a unicode string.

    season_number:  Number of the season the video episode belongs to, as an integer.
    season_id:      Id of the season the video episode belongs to, as a unicode string.
    episode:        Title of the video episode. Unlike mandatory video title field,
                    this field should denote the exact title of the video episode
                    without any kind of decoration.
    episode_number: Number of the video episode within a season, as an integer.
    episode_id:     Id of the video episode, as a unicode string.

    The following fields should only be used when the media is a track or a part of
    a music album:

    track:          Title of the track.
    track_number:   Number of the track within an album or a disc, as an integer.
    track_id:       Id of the track (useful in case of custom indexing, e.g. 6.iii),
                    as a unicode string.
    artists:        List of artists of the track.
    composers:      List of composers of the piece.
    genres:         List of genres of the track.
    album:          Title of the album the track belongs to.
    album_type:     Type of the album (e.g. "Demo", "Full-length", "Split", "Compilation", etc).
    album_artists:  List of all artists appeared on the album.
                    E.g. ["Ash Borer", "Fell Voices"] or ["Various Artists"].
                    Useful for splits and compilations.
    disc_number:    Number of the disc or other physical medium the track belongs to,
                    as an integer.

    The following fields should only be set for clips that should be cut from the original video:

    section_start:  Start time of the section in seconds
    section_end:    End time of the section in seconds

    The following fields should only be set for storyboards:
    rows:           Number of rows in each storyboard fragment, as an integer
    columns:        Number of columns in each storyboard fragment, as an integer

    The following fields are deprecated and should not be set by new code:
    composer:       Use "composers" instead.
                    Composer(s) of the piece, comma-separated.
    artist:         Use "artists" instead.
                    Artist(s) of the track, comma-separated.
    genre:          Use "genres" instead.
                    Genre(s) of the track, comma-separated.
    album_artist:   Use "album_artists" instead.
                    All artists appeared on the album, comma-separated.
    creator:        Use "creators" instead.
                    The creator of the video.

    Unless mentioned otherwise, the fields should be Unicode strings.

    Unless mentioned otherwise, None is equivalent to absence of information.


    _type "playlist" indicates multiple videos.
    There must be a key "entries", which is a list, an iterable, or a PagedList
    object, each element of which is a valid dictionary by this specification.

    Additionally, playlists can have "id", "title", and any other relevant
    attributes with the same semantics as videos (see above).

    It can also have the following optional fields:

    playlist_count: The total number of videos in a playlist. If not given,
                    YoutubeDL tries to calculate it from "entries"


    _type "multi_video" indicates that there are multiple videos that
    form a single show, for examples multiple acts of an opera or TV episode.
    It must have an entries key like a playlist and contain all the keys
    required for a video at the same time.


    _type "url" indicates that the video must be extracted from another
    location, possibly by a different extractor. Its only required key is:
    "url" - the next URL to extract.
    The key "ie_key" can be set to the class name (minus the trailing "IE",
    e.g. "Youtube") if the extractor class is known in advance.
    Additionally, the dictionary may have any properties of the resolved entity
    known in advance, for example "title" if the title of the referred video is
    known ahead of time.


    _type "url_transparent" entities have the same specification as "url", but
    indicate that the given additional information is more precise than the one
    associated with the resolved URL.
    This is useful when a site employs a video service that hosts the video and
    its technical metadata, but that video service does not embed a useful
    title, description etc.


    Subclasses of this should also be added to the list of extractors and
    should define _VALID_URL as a regexp or a Sequence of regexps, and
    re-define the _real_extract() and (optionally) _real_initialize() methods.

    Subclasses may also override suitable() if necessary, but ensure the function
    signature is preserved and that this function imports everything it needs
    (except other extractors), so that lazy_extractors works correctly.

    Subclasses can define a list of _EMBED_REGEX, which will be searched for in
    the HTML of Generic webpages. It may also override _extract_embed_urls
    or _extract_from_webpage as necessary. While these are normally classmethods,
    _extract_from_webpage is allowed to be an instance method.

    _extract_from_webpage may raise self.StopExtraction to stop further
    processing of the webpage and obtain exclusive rights to it. This is useful
    when the extractor cannot reliably be matched using just the URL,
    e.g. invidious/peertube instances

    Embed-only extractors can be defined by setting _VALID_URL = False.

    To support username + password (or netrc) login, the extractor must define a
    _NETRC_MACHINE and re-define _perform_login(username, password) and
    (optionally) _initialize_pre_login() methods. The _perform_login method will
    be called between _initialize_pre_login and _real_initialize if credentials
    are passed by the user. In cases where it is necessary to have the login
    process as part of the extraction rather than initialization, _perform_login
    can be left undefined.

    _GEO_BYPASS attribute may be set to False in order to disable
    geo restriction bypass mechanisms for a particular extractor.
    Though it won't disable explicit geo restriction bypass based on
    country code provided with geo_bypass_country.

    _GEO_COUNTRIES attribute may contain a list of presumably geo unrestricted
    countries for this extractor. One of these countries will be used by
    geo restriction bypass mechanism right away in order to bypass
    geo restriction, of course, if the mechanism is not disabled.

    _GEO_IP_BLOCKS attribute may contain a list of presumably geo unrestricted
    IP blocks in CIDR notation for this extractor. One of these IP blocks
    will be used by geo restriction bypass mechanism similarly
    to _GEO_COUNTRIES.

    The _ENABLED attribute should be set to False for IEs that
    are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled.

    The _WORKING attribute should be set to False for broken IEs
    in order to warn the users and skip the tests.
