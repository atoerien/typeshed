    The ``JSONLIterator`` is used to iterate over JSON-encoded objects
    stored in the `JSON Lines format`_ (one object per line).

    Most notably it has the ability to efficiently read from the
    bottom of files, making it very effective for reading in simple
    append-only JSONL use cases. It also has the ability to start from
    anywhere in the file and ignore corrupted lines.

    Args:
        file_obj (file): An open file object.
        ignore_errors (bool): Whether to skip over lines that raise an error on
            deserialization (:func:`json.loads`).
        reverse (bool): Controls the direction of the iteration.
            Defaults to ``False``. If set to ``True`` and *rel_seek*
            is unset, seeks to the end of the file before iteration
            begins.
        rel_seek (float): Used to preseek the start position of
            iteration. Set to 0.0 for the start of the file, 1.0 for the
