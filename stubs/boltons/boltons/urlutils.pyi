"""
:mod:`urlutils` is a module dedicated to one of software's most
versatile, well-aged, and beloved data structures: the URL, also known
as the `Uniform Resource Locator`_.

Among other things, this module is a full reimplementation of URLs,
without any reliance on the :mod:`urlparse` or :mod:`urllib` standard
library modules. The centerpiece and top-level interface of urlutils
is the :class:`URL` type. Also featured is the :func:`find_all_links`
convenience function. Some low-level functions and constants are also
below.

The implementations in this module are based heavily on `RFC 3986`_ and
`RFC 3987`_, and incorporates details from several other RFCs and `W3C
documents`_.

class URL:
    r"""
    The URL is one of the most ubiquitous data structures in the
    virtual and physical landscape. From blogs to billboards, URLs are
    so common, that it's easy to overlook their complexity and
    power.

    There are 8 parts of a URL, each with its own semantics and
    special characters:

      * :attr:`~URL.scheme`
      * :attr:`~URL.username`
      * :attr:`~URL.password`
      * :attr:`~URL.host`
      * :attr:`~URL.port`
      * :attr:`~URL.path`
      * :attr:`~URL.query_params` (query string parameters)
      * :attr:`~URL.fragment`

    Each is exposed as an attribute on the URL object. RFC 3986 offers
    this brief structural summary of the main URL components::

        foo://user:pass@example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
        \_/   \_______/ \_________/ \__/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
         |        |          |        |      |           |        |
       scheme  userinfo     host     port   path       query   fragment

    And here's how that example can be manipulated with the URL type:

    >>> url = URL('foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose')
    >>> print(url.host)
    example.com
    >>> print(url.get_authority())
    example.com:8042
    >>> print(url.qp['name'])  # qp is a synonym for query_params
    ferret

    URL's approach to encoding is that inputs are decoded as much as
    possible, and data remains in this decoded state until re-encoded
    using the :meth:`~URL.to_text()` method. In this way, it's similar
    to Python's current approach of encouraging immediate decoding of
    bytes to text.

    Note that URL instances are mutable objects. If an immutable
    representation of the URL is desired, the string from
    :meth:`~URL.to_text()` may be used. For an immutable, but
    almost-as-featureful, URL object, check out the `hyperlink
    package`_.

        Whether or not a URL uses :code:`:` or :code:`://` to separate the

        standard definition. There is no way to infer this behavior
        from other parts of the URL. A scheme either supports network
        locations or it does not.

        The URL type's approach to this is to check for explicitly
        registered schemes, with common schemes like HTTP
        preregistered. This is the same approach taken by
        :mod:`urlparse`.

        URL adds two additional heuristics if the scheme as a whole is
        not registered. First, it attempts to check the subpart of the
        scheme after the last ``+`` character. This adds intuitive
        behavior for schemes like ``git+ssh``. Second, if a URL with
        an unrecognized scheme is loaded, it will maintain the
