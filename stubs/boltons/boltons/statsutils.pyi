``statsutils`` provides tools aimed primarily at descriptive
statistics for data analysis, such as :func:`mean` (average),
:func:`median`, :func:`variance`, and many others,

The :class:`Stats` type provides all the main functionality of the
``statsutils`` module. A :class:`Stats` object wraps a given dataset,
providing all statistical measures as property attributes. These
attributes cache their results, which allows efficient computation of
multiple measures, as many measures rely on other measures. For
example, relative standard deviation (:attr:`Stats.rel_std_dev`)
relies on both the mean and standard deviation. The Stats object
caches those results so no rework is done.

The :class:`Stats` type's attributes have module-level counterparts for
convenience when the computation reuse advantages do not apply.

>>> stats = Stats(range(42))
>>> stats.mean
20.5
>>> mean(range(42))
20.5

Statistics is a large field, and ``statsutils`` is focused on a few
basic techniques that are useful in software. The following is a brief
introduction to those techniques. For a more in-depth introduction,
`Statistics for Software
<https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2016/04/11/statistics-for-software/>`_,
an article I wrote on the topic. It introduces key terminology vital
to effective usage of statistics.

Statistical moments
-------------------

Python programmers are probably familiar with the concept of the
*mean* or *average*, which gives a rough quantitiative middle value by
which a sample can be can be generalized. However, the mean is just
the first of four `moment`_-based measures by which a sample or
distribution can be measured.

The four `Standardized moments`_ are:

  1. `Mean`_ - :func:`mean` - theoretical middle value
  2. `Variance`_ - :func:`variance` - width of value dispersion
  3. `Skewness`_ - :func:`skewness` - symmetry of distribution
  4. `Kurtosis`_ - :func:`kurtosis` - "peakiness" or "long-tailed"-ness

For more information check out `the Moment article on Wikipedia`_.

.. _moment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)
.. _Standardized moments: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_moment
.. _Mean: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean
.. _Variance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance
.. _Skewness: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness
.. _Kurtosis: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis
.. _the Moment article on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)

Keep in mind that while these moments can give a bit more insight into
the shape and distribution of data, they do not guarantee a complete
picture. Wildly different datasets can have the same values for all
four moments, so generalize wisely.

Robust statistics
-----------------

Moment-based statistics are notorious for being easily skewed by
outliers. The whole field of robust statistics aims to mitigate this
dilemma. ``statsutils`` also includes several robust statistical methods:

  * `Median`_ - The middle value of a sorted dataset
  * `Trimean`_ - Another robust measure of the data's central tendency
  * `Median Absolute Deviation`_ (MAD) - A robust measure of
    variability, a natural counterpart to :func:`variance`.
  * `Trimming`_ - Reducing a dataset to only the middle majority of
    data is a simple way of making other estimators more robust.

.. _Trimean: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimean
.. _Median Absolute Deviation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation
.. _Trimming: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimmed_estimator


Online and Offline Statistics
-----------------------------

Unrelated to computer networking, `online`_ statistics involve
calculating statistics in a `streaming`_ fashion, without all the data
being available. The :class:`Stats` type is meant for the more
traditional offline statistics when all the data is available. For
pure-Python online statistics accumulators, look at the `Lithoxyl`_
system instrumentation package.
