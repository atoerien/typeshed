"""
Python's builtin :class:`list` is a very fast and efficient
sequence type, but it could be better for certain access patterns,
such as non-sequential insertion into a large lists. ``listutils``
provides a pure-Python solution to this problem.

For utilities for working with iterables and lists, check out
:mod:`iterutils`. For the a :class:`list`-based version of
:class:`collections.namedtuple`, check out :mod:`namedutils`.

    The ``BarrelList`` is a :class:`list` subtype backed by many
    dynamically-scaled sublists, to provide better scaling and random
    insertion/deletion characteristics. It is a subtype of the builtin
    :class:`list` and has an identical API, supporting indexing,
    slicing, sorting, etc. If application requirements call for
    something more performant, consider the `blist module available on
    PyPI`_.

    The name comes by way of Kurt Rose, who said it reminded him of
    barrel shifters. Not sure how, but it's BList-like, so the name
    stuck. BList is of course a reference to `B-trees`_.

    Args:
        iterable: An optional iterable of initial values for the list.

    >>> blist = BList(range(100000))
    >>> blist.pop(50000)
    50000
    >>> len(blist)
    99999
    >>> len(blist.lists)  # how many underlying lists
    8
    >>> slice_idx = blist.lists[0][-1]
    >>> blist[slice_idx:slice_idx + 2]
    BarrelList([11637, 11638])

    Slicing is supported and works just fine across list borders,
    returning another instance of the BarrelList.
