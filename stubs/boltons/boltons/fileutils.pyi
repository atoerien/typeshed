    The :class:`FilePerms` type is used to represent standard POSIX

      * Owning (u)ser

    This class assists with computing new permissions, as well as

    permissions. Currently it only considers the bottom 9 permission
    bits; it does not support sticky bits or more advanced permission
    systems.

        user (str): A string in the 'rwx' format, omitting characters

        other (str): A string in the 'rwx' format, omitting characters
            for which owning other/world permissions are not provided.

class AtomicSaver:
    """
    ``AtomicSaver`` is a configurable `context manager`_ that provides
    a writable :class:`file` which will be moved into place as long as
    no exceptions are raised within the context manager's block. These
    "part files" are created in the same directory as the destination
    path to ensure atomic move operations (i.e., no cross-filesystem
    moves occur).

    Args:
        dest_path (str): The path where the completed file will be
            written.
        overwrite (bool): Whether to overwrite the destination file if
            it exists at completion time. Defaults to ``True``.
        file_perms (int): Integer representation of file permissions
            for the newly-created file. Defaults are, when the
            destination path already exists, to copy the permissions
            from the previous file, or if the file did not exist, to
            respect the user's configured `umask`_, usually resulting
            in octal 0644 or 0664.
        text_mode (bool): Whether to open the destination file in text
            mode (i.e., ``'w'`` not ``'wb'``). Defaults to ``False`` (``wb``).
        part_file (str): Name of the temporary *part_file*. Defaults
            to *dest_path* + ``.part``. Note that this argument is
            just the filename, and not the full path of the part
            file. To guarantee atomic saves, part files are always
            created in the same directory as the destination path.
        overwrite_part (bool): Whether to overwrite the *part_file*,
            should it exist at setup time. Defaults to ``False``,
            which results in an :exc:`OSError` being raised on
            pre-existing part files. Be careful of setting this to
            ``True`` in situations when multiple threads or processes
            could be writing to the same part file.
        rm_part_on_exc (bool): Remove *part_file* on exception cases.
            Defaults to ``True``, but ``False`` can be useful for
            recovery in some cases. Note that resumption is not
            automatic and by default an :exc:`OSError` is raised if
            the *part_file* exists.

    Practically, the AtomicSaver serves a few purposes:

      * Avoiding overwriting an existing, valid file with a partially
        written one.
      * Providing a reasonable guarantee that a part file only has one
        writer at a time.
      * Optional recovery of partial data in failure cases.
