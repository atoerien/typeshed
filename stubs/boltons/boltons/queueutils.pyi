"""
Python comes with a many great data structures, from :class:`dict`
to :class:`collections.deque`, and no shortage of serviceable
algorithm implementations, from :func:`sorted` to :mod:`bisect`. But
priority queues are curiously relegated to an example documented in
:mod:`heapq`. Even there, the approach presented is not full-featured
and object-oriented. There is a built-in priority queue,
:class:`Queue.PriorityQueue`, but in addition to its austere API, it
carries the double-edged sword of threadsafety, making it fine for
multi-threaded, multi-consumer applications, but high-overhead for
cooperative/single-threaded use cases.

The ``queueutils`` module currently provides two Queue
implementations: :class:`HeapPriorityQueue`, based on a heap, and
:class:`SortedPriorityQueue`, based on a sorted list. Both use a
unified API based on :class:`BasePriorityQueue` to facilitate testing
the slightly different performance characteristics on various
application use cases.

>>> pq = PriorityQueue()
>>> pq.add('low priority task', 0)
>>> pq.add('high priority task', 2)
>>> pq.add('medium priority task 1', 1)
>>> pq.add('medium priority task 2', 1)
>>> len(pq)
4
>>> pq.pop()
'high priority task'
>>> pq.peek()
'medium priority task 1'
>>> len(pq)
3
