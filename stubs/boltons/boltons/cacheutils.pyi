"""
``cacheutils`` contains consistent implementations of fundamental
cache types. Currently there are two to choose from:

  * :class:`LRI` - Least-recently inserted
  * :class:`LRU` - Least-recently used

Both caches are :class:`dict` subtypes, designed to be as
interchangeable as possible, to facilitate experimentation. A key
practice with performance enhancement with caching is ensuring that
the caching strategy is working. If the cache is constantly missing,
it is just adding more overhead and code complexity. The standard
statistics are:

  * ``hit_count`` - the number of times the queried key has been in
    the cache
  * ``miss_count`` - the number of times a key has been absent and/or
    fetched by the cache
  * ``soft_miss_count`` - the number of times a key has been absent,
    but a default has been provided by the caller, as with
    :meth:`dict.get` and :meth:`dict.setdefault`. Soft misses are a
    subset of misses, so this number is always less than or equal to
    ``miss_count``.

Additionally, ``cacheutils`` provides :class:`ThresholdCounter`, a
cache-like bounded counter useful for online statistics collection.

    being that counted items cannot be set directly, uncounted, or
    removed, as this would disrupt the math.

    Use the ThresholdCounter when you need best-effort long-lived
    counts for dynamically-keyed data. Without a bounded datastructure

    one or two orders of magnitude better for real-world data.
