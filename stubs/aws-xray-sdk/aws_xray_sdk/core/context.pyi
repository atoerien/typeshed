    The context storage class to store trace entities(segments/subsegments).
    The default implementation uses threadlocal to store these entities.

    replace the current stored entities and to clean up the storage.

    For any data access or data mutation, if there is no active segment present
    it will use user-defined behavior to handle such case. By default it throws
    an runtime error.
