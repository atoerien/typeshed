        Configure global X-Ray recorder.

        Configure needs to run before patching thrid party libraries
        to avoid creating dangling subsegment.

        :param bool sampling: If sampling is enabled, every time the recorder
            creates a segment it decides whether to send this segment to
            the X-Ray daemon. This setting is not used if the recorder
            is running in AWS Lambda. The recorder always respect the incoming
            sampling decisions regardless of this setting.
        :param sampling_rules: Pass a set of local custom sampling rules.
            Can be an absolute path of the sampling rule config json file
            or a dictionary that defines those rules. This will also be the
            fallback rules in case of centralized sampling opted-in while
            the cetralized sampling rules are not available.
        :param sampler: The sampler used to make sampling decisions. The SDK
            provides two built-in samplers. One is centralized rules based and
            the other is local rules based. The former is the default.
        :param tuple plugins: plugins that add extra metadata to each segment.
            Currently available plugins are EC2Plugin, ECS plugin and
            ElasticBeanstalkPlugin.
            If you want to disable all previously enabled plugins,
            pass an empty tuple ``()``.
        :param str context_missing: recorder behavior when it tries to mutate
            a segment or add a subsegment but there is no active segment.
            RUNTIME_ERROR means the recorder will raise an exception.
            LOG_ERROR means the recorder will only log the error and
            do nothing.
            IGNORE_ERROR means the recorder will do nothing
        :param str daemon_address: The X-Ray daemon address where the recorder
            sends data to.
        :param str service: default segment name if creating a segment without
            providing a name.
        :param context: You can pass your own implementation of context storage
            for active segment/subsegment by overriding the default
            ``Context`` class.
        :param emitter: The emitter that sends a segment/subsegment to
            the X-Ray daemon. You can override ``UDPEmitter`` class.
        :param dynamic_naming: a string that defines a pattern that host names
            should match. Alternatively you can pass a module which
            overrides ``DefaultDynamicNaming`` module.
        :param streaming: The streaming module to stream out trace documents
            when they grow too large. You can override ``DefaultStreaming``
            class to have your own implementation of the streaming process.
        :param streaming_threshold: If breaks within a single segment it will
            start streaming out children subsegments. By default it is the
            maximum number of subsegments within a segment.
        :param int max_trace_back: The maxinum number of stack traces recorded
            by auto-capture. Lower this if a single document becomes too large.
        :param bool stream_sql: Whether SQL query texts should be streamed.

        Environment variables AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS, AWS_XRAY_CONTEXT_MISSING
        and AWS_XRAY_TRACING_NAME respectively overrides arguments
        daemon_address, context_missing and service.
