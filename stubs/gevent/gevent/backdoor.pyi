Interactive greenlet-based network console that can be used in any process.

The :class:`BackdoorServer` provides a REPL inside a running process. As
long as the process is monkey-patched, the ``BackdoorServer`` can coexist
with other elements of the process.

    Provide a backdoor to a program for debugging purposes.

    .. warning:: This backdoor provides no authentication and makes no
          attempt to limit what remote users can do. Anyone that
          can access the server can take any action that the running
          python process can. Thus, while you may bind to any interface, for
          security purposes it is recommended that you bind to one
          only accessible to the local machine, e.g.,
          127.0.0.1/localhost.

    Basic usage::

        from gevent.backdoor import BackdoorServer
        server = BackdoorServer(('127.0.0.1', 5001),
                                banner="Hello from gevent backdoor!",
                                locals={'foo': "From defined scope!"})
        server.serve_forever()

    In a another terminal, connect with...::

        $ telnet 127.0.0.1 5001
        Trying 127.0.0.1...
        Connected to 127.0.0.1.
        Escape character is '^]'.
        Hello from gevent backdoor!
        >> print(foo)
        From defined scope!
