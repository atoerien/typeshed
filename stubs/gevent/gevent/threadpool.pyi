    """
    A pool of native worker threads.

    This can be useful for CPU intensive functions, or those that
    otherwise will not cooperate with gevent. The best functions to execute
    in a thread pool are small functions with a single purpose; ideally they release
    the CPython GIL. Such functions are extension functions implemented in C.

    It implements the same operations as a :class:`gevent.pool.Pool`,
    but using threads instead of greenlets.

    .. note:: The method :meth:`apply_async` will always return a new
       greenlet, bypassing the threadpool entirely.

    Most users will not need to create instances of this class. Instead,
    use the threadpool already associated with gevent's hub::

        pool = gevent.get_hub().threadpool
        result = pool.spawn(lambda: "Some func").get()

    .. important:: It is only possible to use instances of this class from
       the thread running their hub. Typically that means from the thread that
       created them. Using the pattern shown above takes care of this.

       There is no gevent-provided way to have a single process-wide limit on the
       number of threads in various pools when doing that, however. The suggested
       way to use gevent and threadpools is to have a single gevent hub
       and its one threadpool (which is the default without doing any extra work).
       Only dispatch minimal blocking functions to the threadpool, functions that
       do not use the gevent hub.

    The `len` of instances of this class is the number of enqueued
    (unfinished) tasks.

    Just before a task starts running in a worker thread,
    the values of :func:`threading.setprofile` and :func:`threading.settrace`
    are consulted. Any values there are installed in that thread for the duration
    of the task (using :func:`sys.setprofile` and :func:`sys.settrace`, respectively).
    (Because worker threads are long-lived and outlast any given task, this arrangement
    lets the hook functions change between tasks, but does not let them see the
    bookkeeping done by the worker thread itself.)

    .. caution:: Instances of this class are only true if they have
       unfinished tasks.
