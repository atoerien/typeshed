    :keyword exception: The type of exception to raise in the greenlets. By default this is
        :class:`GreenletExit`.
    :keyword bool block: If True (the default) then this function only returns when all the
        greenlets are dead; the current greenlet is unscheduled during that process.
        If greenlets ignore the initial exception raised in them,
        then they will be joined (with :func:`gevent.joinall`) and allowed to die naturally.
        If False, this function returns immediately and greenlets will raise
        the exception asynchronously.
    :keyword float timeout: A time in seconds to wait for greenlets to die. If given, it is
        only honored when ``block`` is True.
    :raise Timeout: If blocking and a timeout is given that elapses before
        all the greenlets are dead.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.1a2
        *greenlets* can be any iterable of greenlets, like an iterator or a set.
        Previously it had to be a list or tuple.
    .. versionchanged:: 1.5a3
        Any :class:`Greenlet` in the *greenlets* list that hadn't been switched to before
        calling this method will never be switched to. This makes this function
        behave like :meth:`Greenlet.kill`. This does not apply to raw greenlets.
    .. versionchanged:: 1.5a3
        Now accepts raw greenlets created by :func:`gevent.spawn_raw`.
