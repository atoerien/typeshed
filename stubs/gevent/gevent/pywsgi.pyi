"""
A pure-Python, gevent-friendly WSGI server implementing HTTP/1.1.

The server is provided in :class:`WSGIServer`, but most of the actual
WSGI work is handled by :class:`WSGIHandler` --- a new instance is
created for each request. The server can be customized to use
different subclasses of :class:`WSGIHandler`.

.. important::

   This server is intended primarily for development and testing, and
   secondarily for other "safe" scenarios where it will not be exposed to
   potentially malicious input. The code has not been security audited,
   and is not intended for direct exposure to the public Internet. For production
   usage on the Internet, either choose a production-strength server such as
   gunicorn, or put a reverse proxy between gevent and the Internet.

.. versionchanged:: 23.9.0

   Complies more closely with the HTTP specification for chunked transfer encoding.
   In particular, we are much stricter about trailers, and trailers that
   are invalid (too long or featuring disallowed characters) forcibly close
   the connection to the client *after* the results have been sent.

   Trailers otherwise continue to be ignored and are not available to the
   WSGI application.

            loop should terminate and perform cleanup steps.
        - (status, body)
            An HTTP status and body tuple. The request was in error,
            as detailed by the status and body. The request handling
            loop should terminate, close the connection, and perform
            cleanup steps. Note that the ``body`` is the complete contents
            to send to the client, including all headers and the initial
            status line.
        - ``True``
            The literal ``True`` value. The request was successfully handled
            and the response sent to the client by :meth:`handle_one_response`.
            The connection remains open to process more requests and the connection

    Provisional API.

    This is intended to keep potentially sensitive information like
    HTTP authorization and cookies from being inadvertently printed
    or logged.

    For debugging, each instance can have its *secure_repr* attribute
    set to ``False``, which will cause it to print like a normal dict.

    When *secure_repr* is ``True`` (the default), then the value of
    the *whitelist_keys* attribute is consulted; if this value is
    true-ish, it should be a container (something that responds to
    ``in``) of key names (typically a list or set). Keys and values in
    this dictionary that are in *whitelist_keys* will then be printed,
    while all other values will be masked. These values may be
    customized on the class by setting the *default_secure_repr* and
    *default_whitelist_keys*, respectively::

        >>> environ = SecureEnviron(key='value')
        >>> environ # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        <pywsgi.SecureEnviron dict (keys: 1) at ...

    If we whitelist the key, it gets printed::

        >>> environ.whitelist_keys = {'key'}
        >>> environ

    A non-whitelisted key (*only*, to avoid doctest issues) is masked::

        >>> environ['secure'] = 'secret'; del environ['key']
