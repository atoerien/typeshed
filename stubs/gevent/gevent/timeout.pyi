Timeouts.

Many functions in :mod:`gevent` have a *timeout* argument that allows
limiting the time the function will block. When that is not available,
the :class:`Timeout` class and :func:`with_timeout` function in this
module add timeouts to arbitrary code.

.. warning::

    Timeouts can only work when the greenlet switches to the hub.
    If a blocking function is called or an intense calculation is ongoing during
    which no switches occur, :class:`Timeout` is powerless.

    Timeout(seconds=None, exception=None, ref=True, priority=-1)

    Raise *exception* in the current greenlet after *seconds*
    have elapsed::

        timeout = Timeout(seconds, exception)
        timeout.start()
        try:
            ...  # exception will be raised here, after *seconds* passed since start() call
        finally:
            timeout.close()

    .. warning::

        You must **always** call `close` on a ``Timeout`` object you have created,
        whether or not the code that the timeout was protecting finishes
        executing before the timeout elapses (whether or not the
        ``Timeout`` exception is raised)  This ``try/finally``
        construct or a ``with`` statement is a good pattern. (If
        the timeout object will be started again, use `cancel` instead
        of `close`; this is rare. You must still `close` it when you are
        done.)

    When *exception* is omitted or ``None``, the ``Timeout`` instance
    itself is raised::

        >>> import gevent
        >>> gevent.Timeout(0.1).start()
        >>> gevent.sleep(0.2)  #doctest: +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL
        Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
        Timeout: 0.1 seconds

    If the *seconds* argument is not given or is ``None`` (e.g.,
    ``Timeout()``), then the timeout will never expire and never raise
    *exception*. This is convenient for creating functions which take
    an optional timeout parameter of their own. (Note that this is **not**
    the same thing as a *seconds* value of ``0``.)

    ::

       def function(args, timeout=None):
          "A function with an optional timeout."
          timer = Timeout(timeout)
          with timer:
             ...

    .. caution::

        A *seconds* value less than ``0.0`` (e.g., ``-1``) is poorly defined. In the future,
        support for negative values is likely to do the same thing as a value
        of ``None`` or ``0``

    A *seconds* value of ``0`` requests that the event loop spin and poll for I/O;
    it will immediately expire as soon as control returns to the event loop.

    .. rubric:: Use As A Context Manager

    To simplify starting and canceling timeouts, the ``with``
    statement can be used::

        with gevent.Timeout(seconds, exception) as timeout:
            pass  # ... code block ...

    This is equivalent to the try/finally block above with one
    additional feature: if *exception* is the literal ``False``, the
    timeout is still raised, but the context manager suppresses it, so
    the code outside the with-block won't see it.

    This is handy for adding a timeout to the functions that don't
    support a *timeout* parameter themselves::

        data = None
        with gevent.Timeout(5, False):
            data = mysock.makefile().readline()
        if data is None:
            ...  # 5 seconds passed without reading a line
        else:
            ...  # a line was read within 5 seconds

    .. caution::

        If ``readline()`` above catches and doesn't re-raise
        :exc:`BaseException` (for example, with a bare ``except:``), then
        your timeout will fail to function and control won't be returned
        to you when you expect.

    .. rubric:: Catching Timeouts

    When catching timeouts, keep in mind that the one you catch may
    not be the one you have set (a calling function may have set its
    own timeout); if you are going to silence a timeout, always check that
    it's the instance you need::

        timeout = Timeout(1)
        timeout.start()
        try:
            ...
        except Timeout as t:
            if t is not timeout:
                raise # not my timeout
        finally:
            timeout.close()


    .. versionchanged:: 1.1b2

        If *seconds* is not given or is ``None``, no longer allocate a
        native timer object that will never be started.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.1

        Add warning about negative *seconds* values.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.3a1

        Timeout objects now have a :meth:`close`
        method that *must* be called when the timeout will no longer be
        used to properly clean up native resources.
        The ``with`` statement does this automatically.

    .. versionchanged:: 24.10.1

          Timeout values can be compared to be less than an integer value,
          or to be less than other timeouts, e.g., ``Timeout(0) < 1`` is true.
          Timeouts are not absolutely ordered and support no other comparisons; this
          is purely for convenience and may be removed or altered in the future.
