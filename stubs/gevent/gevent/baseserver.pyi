class BaseServer(Generic[Unpack[_Ts]]):
    """
    An abstract base class that implements some common functionality for the servers in gevent.

    :param listener: Either be an address that the server should bind
        on or a :class:`gevent.socket.socket` instance that is already
        bound (and put into listening mode in case of TCP socket).

    :keyword handle: If given, the request handler. The request
        handler can be defined in a few ways. Most commonly,
        subclasses will implement a ``handle`` method as an
        instance method. Alternatively, a function can be passed
        as the ``handle`` argument to the constructor. In either
        case, the handler can later be changed by calling
        :meth:`set_handle`.

        When the request handler returns, the socket used for the
        request will be closed. Therefore, the handler must not return if
        the socket is still in use (for example, by manually spawned greenlets).

    :keyword spawn: If provided, is called to create a new
        greenlet to run the handler. By default,
        :func:`gevent.spawn` is used (meaning there is no
        artificial limit on the number of concurrent requests). Possible values for *spawn*:

        - a :class:`gevent.pool.Pool` instance -- ``handle`` will be executed
          using :meth:`gevent.pool.Pool.spawn` only if the pool is not full.
          While it is full, no new connections are accepted;
        - :func:`gevent.spawn_raw` -- ``handle`` will be executed in a raw
          greenlet which has a little less overhead then :class:`gevent.Greenlet` instances spawned by default;
        - ``None`` -- ``handle`` will be executed right away, in the :class:`Hub` greenlet.
          ``handle`` cannot use any blocking functions as it would mean switching to the :class:`Hub`.
        - an integer -- a shortcut for ``gevent.pool.Pool(integer)``

    .. versionchanged:: 1.1a1
       When the *handle* function returns from processing a connection,
       the client socket will be closed. This resolves the non-deterministic
       closing of the socket, fixing ResourceWarnings under Python 3 and PyPy.
    .. versionchanged:: 1.5
       Now a context manager that returns itself and calls :meth:`stop` on exit.
