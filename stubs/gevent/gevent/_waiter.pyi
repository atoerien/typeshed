class Waiter(Generic[_T]):
    """
    Waiter(hub=None)

    A low level communication utility for greenlets.

    Waiter is a wrapper around greenlet's ``switch()`` and ``throw()`` calls that makes them somewhat safer:

    * switching will occur only if the waiting greenlet is executing :meth:`get` method currently;
    * any error raised in the greenlet is handled inside :meth:`switch` and :meth:`throw`
    * if :meth:`switch`/:meth:`throw` is called before the receiver calls :meth:`get`, then :class:`Waiter`
      will store the value/exception. The following :meth:`get` will return the value/raise the exception.

    The :meth:`switch` and :meth:`throw` methods must only be called from the :class:`Hub` greenlet.
    The :meth:`get` method must be called from a greenlet other than :class:`Hub`.

        >>> from gevent.hub import Waiter
        >>> from gevent import get_hub
        >>> result = Waiter()
        >>> timer = get_hub().loop.timer(0.1)
        >>> timer.start(result.switch, 'hello from Waiter')
        >>> result.get() # blocks for 0.1 seconds
        'hello from Waiter'
        >>> timer.close()

    If switch is called before the greenlet gets a chance to call :meth:`get` then
    :class:`Waiter` stores the value.

        >>> from gevent.time import sleep
        >>> result = Waiter()
        >>> timer = get_hub().loop.timer(0.1)
        >>> timer.start(result.switch, 'hi from Waiter')
        >>> sleep(0.2)
        >>> result.get() # returns immediately without blocking
        'hi from Waiter'
        >>> timer.close()

    .. warning::

        This is a limited and dangerous way to communicate between
        greenlets. It can easily leave a greenlet unscheduled forever
        if used incorrectly. Consider using safer classes such as
        :class:`gevent.event.Event`, :class:`gevent.event.AsyncResult`,
        or :class:`gevent.queue.Queue`.
