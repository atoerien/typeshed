"""
Synchronized queues.

The :mod:`gevent.queue` module implements multi-producer, multi-consumer queues
that work across greenlets, with the API similar to the classes found in the
standard :mod:`Queue` and :class:`multiprocessing <multiprocessing.Queue>` modules.

The classes in this module implement the iterator protocol. Iterating
over a queue means repeatedly calling :meth:`get <Queue.get>` until
:meth:`get <Queue.get>` returns ``StopIteration`` (specifically that
class, not an instance or subclass).

    >>> import gevent.queue
    >>> queue = gevent.queue.Queue()
    >>> queue.put(1)
    >>> queue.put(2)
    >>> queue.put(StopIteration)
    >>> for item in queue:
    ...    print(item)
    1
    2

.. versionchanged:: 1.0
       ``Queue(0)`` now means queue of infinite size, not a channel. A :exc:`DeprecationWarning`
       will be issued with this argument.

.. versionchanged:: 25.4.1
   :class:`Queue` was renamed to :class:`SimpleQueue`, while :class:`JoinableQueue` was
   renamed to :class:`Queue` (`JoinableQueue` remains a backwards compatible alias).
   This adds the ability to ``join()`` all queues, like the standard library.

   Previously ``SimpleQueue`` was an alias for the undocumented Python
   implementation ``queue._PySimpleQueue``; now it is gevent's own implementation.
   This ensures that it is cooperative even without monkey-patching.

    Create a queue object with a given maximum size.

    If *maxsize* is less than or equal to zero or ``None``, the queue
    size is infinite.

    Queues have a ``len`` equal to the number of items in them (the :meth:`qsize`),
    but in a boolean context they are always True.

       will now be awakened to put their items into the queue in the order in which
       they arrived. Likewise, multiple greenlets that block on a call to :meth:`get` for
       an empty queue will now receive items in the order in which they blocked. An

       previously anyway, but that wasn't the case for PyPy.
