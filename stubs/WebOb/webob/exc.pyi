"""
This module processes Python exceptions that relate to HTTP exceptions
by defining a set of exceptions, all subclasses of HTTPException.
Each exception, in addition to being a Python exception that can be
raised and caught, is also a WSGI application and ``webob.Response``
object.

This module defines exceptions according to RFC 2068 [1]_ : codes with
100-300 are not really errors; 400's are client errors, and 500's are
server errors.  According to the WSGI specification [2]_ , the application
can call ``start_response`` more then once only under two conditions:
(a) the response has not yet been sent, or (b) if the second and
subsequent invocations of ``start_response`` have a valid ``exc_info``
argument obtained from ``sys.exc_info()``.  The WSGI specification then
requires the server or gateway to handle the case where content has been
sent and then an exception was encountered.

Usage notes
-----------

The HTTPException class is complicated by 4 factors:

  1. The content given to the exception may either be plain-text or
     as html-text.

  2. The template may want to have string-substitutions taken from
     the current ``environ`` or values from incoming headers. This
     is especially troublesome due to case sensitivity.

  3. The final output may either be text/plain or text/html
     mime-type as requested by the client application.

  4. Each exception has a default explanation, but those who
     raise exceptions may want to provide additional detail.

Subclass attributes and call parameters are designed to provide an easier path
through the complications.

Attributes:

   ``code``
       the HTTP status code for the exception

   ``title``
       remainder of the status line (stuff after the code)

   ``explanation``
       a plain-text explanation of the error message that is
       not subject to environment or header substitutions;
       it is accessible in the template via %(explanation)s

   ``detail``
       a plain-text message customization that is not subject
       to environment or header substitutions; accessible in
       the template via %(detail)s

   ``body_template``
       a content fragment (in HTML) used for environment and
       header substitution; the default template includes both
       the explanation and further detail provided in the
       message

Parameters:

   ``detail``
     a plain-text override of the default ``detail``

   ``headers``
     a list of (k,v) header pairs

   ``comment``
     a plain-text additional information which is
     usually stripped/hidden for end-users

   ``body_template``
     a string.Template object containing a content fragment in HTML
     that frames the explanation and further detail

To override the template (which is HTML content) or the plain-text
explanation, one must subclass the given exception; or customize it
after it has been created.  This particular breakdown of a message
into explanation, detail and template allows both the creation of
plain-text and html messages for various clients as well as
error-free substitution of environment variables and headers.


The subclasses of :class:`~_HTTPMove`
(:class:`~HTTPMultipleChoices`, :class:`~HTTPMovedPermanently`,
:class:`~HTTPFound`, :class:`~HTTPSeeOther`, :class:`~HTTPUseProxy` and
:class:`~HTTPTemporaryRedirect`) are redirections that require a ``Location``
field. Reflecting this, these subclasses have two additional keyword arguments:
``location`` and ``add_slash``.

Parameters:

    ``location``
      to set the location immediately

    ``add_slash``
      set to True to redirect to the same URL as the request, except with a
      ``/`` appended

Relative URLs in the location will be resolved to absolute.
