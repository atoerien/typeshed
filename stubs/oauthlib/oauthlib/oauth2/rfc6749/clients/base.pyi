    Base OAuth2 client responsible for access token management.

    This class also acts as a generic interface providing methods common to all
    client types such as ``prepare_authorization_request`` and
    ``prepare_token_revocation_request``. The ``prepare_x_request`` methods are
    the recommended way of interacting with clients (as opposed to the abstract
    prepare uri/body/etc methods). They are recommended over the older set
    because they are easier to use (more consistent) and add a few additional
    security checks, such as HTTPS and state checking.

    Some of these methods require further implementation only provided by the
    specific purpose clients such as
    :py:class:`oauthlib.oauth2.MobileApplicationClient` and thus you should always
    seek to use the client class matching the OAuth workflow you need. For
    Python, this is usually :py:class:`oauthlib.oauth2.WebApplicationClient`.
