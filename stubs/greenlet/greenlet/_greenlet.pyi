    get_clocks_used_doing_optional_cleanup() -> Integer

    Get the number of clock ticks the program has used doing optional greenlet cleanup.
    Beginning in greenlet 2.0, greenlet tries to find and dispose of greenlets
    that leaked after a thread exited. This requires invoking Python's garbage collector,
    which may have a performance cost proportional to the number of live objects.
    This function returns the amount of processor time
    greenlet has used to do this. In programs that run with very large amounts of live
    objects, this metric can be used to decide whether the cost of doing this cleanup
    is worth the memory leak being corrected. If not, you can disable the cleanup
    using ``enable_optional_cleanup(False)``.
    The units are arbitrary and can only be compared to themselves (similarly to ``time.clock()``);
    for example, to see how it scales with your heap. You can attempt to convert them into seconds
    by dividing by the value of CLOCKS_PER_SEC.If cleanup has been disabled, returns None.
    This is an implementation specific, provisional API. It may be changed or removed
    in the future.
