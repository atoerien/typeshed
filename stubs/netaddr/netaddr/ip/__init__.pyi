              >>> IPAddress('010', flags=INET_ATON | ZEROFILL)
              IPAddress('0.0.0.10')

            * The default (``0``) or :data:`INET_PTON` – requires four decimal octets:

              >>> IPAddress('10.0.0.1', flags=INET_PTON)
              IPAddress('10.0.0.1')

              Leading zeros may be ignored or rejected, depending on the platform.

            * ``INET_PTON | ZEROFILL`` – like the default :data:`INET_PTON`, except leading
              zeros are discarded:

        Removed the ``implicit_prefix`` switch that used to enable the abbreviated CIDR
        format support, use :func:`cidr_abbrev_to_verbose` if you need this behavior.

        Removed partial IPv4 address support accidentally left when making 1.0.0 release.
        Use :func:`expand_partial_ipv4_address` if you need this behavior.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.3.0
        Added the expand_partial flag, which restores the previous behavior to expand
