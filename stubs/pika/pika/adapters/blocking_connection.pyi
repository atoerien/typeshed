"""
The blocking connection adapter module implements blocking semantics on top
of Pika's core AMQP driver. While most of the asynchronous expectations are
removed when using the blocking connection adapter, it attempts to remain true
to the asynchronous RPC nature of the AMQP protocol, supporting server sent
RPC commands.

The user facing classes in the module consist of the
:py:class:`~pika.adapters.blocking_connection.BlockingConnection`
and the :class:`~pika.adapters.blocking_connection.BlockingChannel`
classes.

class BlockingConnection:
    """
    The BlockingConnection creates a layer on top of Pika's asynchronous core
    providing methods that will block until their expected response has
    returned. Due to the asynchronous nature of the `Basic.Deliver` and
    `Basic.Return` calls from RabbitMQ to your application, you can still
    implement continuation-passing style asynchronous methods if you'd like to
    receive messages from RabbitMQ using
    :meth:`basic_consume <BlockingChannel.basic_consume>` or if you want to be
    notified of a delivery failure when using
    :meth:`basic_publish <BlockingChannel.basic_publish>`.

    For more information about communicating with the blocking_connection
    adapter, be sure to check out the
    :class:`BlockingChannel <BlockingChannel>` class which implements the
    :class:`Channel <pika.channel.Channel>` based communication for the
    blocking_connection adapter.

    To prevent recursion/reentrancy, the blocking connection and channel
    implementations queue asynchronously-delivered events received
    in nested context (e.g., while waiting for `BlockingConnection.channel` or
    `BlockingChannel.queue_declare` to complete), dispatching them synchronously
    once nesting returns to the desired context. This concerns all callbacks,
    such as those registered via `BlockingConnection.call_later`,
    `BlockingConnection.add_on_connection_blocked_callback`,
    `BlockingConnection.add_on_connection_unblocked_callback`,
    `BlockingChannel.basic_consume`, etc.

    Blocked Connection deadlock avoidance: when RabbitMQ becomes low on
    resources, it emits Connection.Blocked (AMQP extension) to the client
    connection when client makes a resource-consuming request on that connection
    or its channel (e.g., `Basic.Publish`); subsequently, RabbitMQ suspsends
    processing requests from that connection until the affected resources are
    restored. See http://www.rabbitmq.com/connection-blocked.html. This
    may impact `BlockingConnection` and `BlockingChannel` operations in a
    way that users might not be expecting. For example, if the user dispatches
    `BlockingChannel.basic_publish` in non-publisher-confirmation mode while
    RabbitMQ is in this low-resource state followed by a synchronous request
    (e.g., `BlockingConnection.channel`, `BlockingChannel.consume`,
    `BlockingChannel.basic_consume`, etc.), the synchronous request will block
    indefinitely (until Connection.Unblocked) waiting for RabbitMQ to reply. If
    the blocked state persists for a long time, the blocking operation will
    appear to hang. In this state, `BlockingConnection` instance and its
    channels will not dispatch user callbacks. SOLUTION: To break this potential
    deadlock, applications may configure the `blocked_connection_timeout`
    connection parameter when instantiating `BlockingConnection`. Upon blocked
    connection timeout, this adapter will raise ConnectionBlockedTimeout
    exception`. See `pika.connection.ConnectionParameters` documentation to
    learn more about the `blocked_connection_timeout` configuration.
