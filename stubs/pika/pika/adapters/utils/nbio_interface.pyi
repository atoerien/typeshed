"""
Non-blocking I/O interface for pika connection adapters.

I/O interface expected by `pika.adapters.base_connection.BaseConnection`

NOTE: This API is modeled after asyncio in python3 for a couple of reasons
    1. It's a sensible API
    2. To make it easy to implement at least on top of the built-in asyncio

Furthermore, the API caters to the needs of pika core and lack of generalization
is intentional for the sake of reducing complexity of the implementation and
testing and lessening the maintenance burden.
