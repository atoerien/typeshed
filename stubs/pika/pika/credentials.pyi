"""
The credentials classes are used to encapsulate all authentication
information for the :class:`~pika.connection.ConnectionParameters` class.

The :class:`~pika.credentials.PlainCredentials` class returns the properly
formatted username and password to the :class:`~pika.connection.Connection`.

To authenticate with Pika, create a :class:`~pika.credentials.PlainCredentials`
object passing in the username and password and pass it as the credentials
argument value to the :class:`~pika.connection.ConnectionParameters` object.

If you are using :class:`~pika.connection.URLParameters` you do not need a
credentials object, one will automatically be created for you.

If you are looking to implement SSL certificate style authentication, you would
extend the :class:`~pika.credentials.ExternalCredentials` class implementing
the required behavior.
