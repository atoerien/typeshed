        Create an object that will check for activity on the provided
        connection as well as receive heartbeat frames from the broker. The
        timeout parameter defines a window within which this activity must
        happen. If not, the connection is considered dead and closed.

        The value passed for timeout is also used to calculate an interval
        at which a heartbeat frame is sent to the broker. The interval is
        equal to the timeout value divided by two.

                            timeout window the connection will be closed. The
                            interval used to send heartbeats is calculated from
