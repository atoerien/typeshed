            The label of the field.

            A sequence of validators to call when `validate` is called.
        :param filters:
            A sequence of callable which are run by :meth:`~Field.process`
            to filter or transform the input data. For example
            ``StringForm(filters=[str.strip, str.upper])``.
            Note that filters are applied after processing the default and
            incoming data, but before validation.
        :param description:
            A description for the field, typically used for help text.

            An id to use for the field. A reasonable default is set by the form,
            and you shouldn't need to set this manually.
        :param default:
            The default value to assign to the field, if no form or object
            input is provided. May be a callable.

            If provided, overrides the widget used to render the field.

            If provided, a dictionary which provides default keywords that
            will be given to the widget at render time.

            The HTML name of this field. The default value is the Python

            A translations object providing message translations. Usually
