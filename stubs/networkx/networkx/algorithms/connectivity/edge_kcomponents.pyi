Algorithms for finding k-edge-connected components and subgraphs.

A k-edge-connected component (k-edge-cc) is a maximal set of nodes in G, such
that all pairs of node have an edge-connectivity of at least k.

A k-edge-connected subgraph (k-edge-subgraph) is a maximal set of nodes in G,
such that the subgraph of G defined by the nodes has an edge-connectivity at
least k.

class EdgeComponentAuxGraph:
    r"""
    A simple algorithm to find all k-edge-connected components in a graph.

    Constructing the auxiliary graph (which may take some time) allows for the
    k-edge-ccs to be found in linear time for arbitrary k.

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation is based on [1]_. The idea is to construct an auxiliary
    graph from which the k-edge-ccs can be extracted in linear time. The
    auxiliary graph is constructed in $O(|V|\cdot F)$ operations, where F is the
    complexity of max flow. Querying the components takes an additional $O(|V|)$
    operations. This algorithm can be slow for large graphs, but it handles an
    arbitrary k and works for both directed and undirected inputs.

    The undirected case for k=1 is exactly connected components.
    The undirected case for k=2 is exactly bridge connected components.
    The directed case for k=1 is exactly strongly connected components.

    >>> # Constructing the AuxGraph takes about O(n ** 4)
    >>> aux_graph = EdgeComponentAuxGraph.construct(G)
    >>> # Once constructed, querying takes O(n)
    >>> sorted(map(sorted, aux_graph.k_edge_components(k=1)))

    >>> sorted(map(sorted, aux_graph.k_edge_components(k=4)))
    [[0], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]

    The auxiliary graph is primarily used for k-edge-ccs but it
    can also speed up the queries of k-edge-subgraphs by refining the
    search space.

        Builds an auxiliary graph encoding edge-connectivity between nodes.

        Notes
        -----
        Given G=(V, E), initialize an empty auxiliary graph A.
        Choose an arbitrary source node s.  Initialize a set N of available
        nodes (that can be used as the sink). The algorithm picks an
        arbitrary node t from N - {s}, and then computes the minimum st-cut
        (S, T) with value w. If G is directed the minimum of the st-cut or
        the ts-cut is used instead. Then, the edge (s, t) is added to the
        auxiliary graph with weight w. The algorithm is called recursively
        first using S as the available nodes and s as the source, and then
        using T and t. Recursion stops when the source is the only available
        node.

        Given the auxiliary graph, the k-edge-connected components can be
        determined in linear time by removing all edges with weights less than
        k from the auxiliary graph.  The resulting connected components are the
        k-edge-ccs in the original graph.
