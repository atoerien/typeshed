"""
Functions measuring similarity using graph edit distance.

The graph edit distance is the number of edge/node changes needed
to make two graphs isomorphic.

The default algorithm/implementation is sub-optimal for some graphs.
The problem of finding the exact Graph Edit Distance (GED) is NP-hard
so it is often slow. If the simple interface `graph_edit_distance`
takes too long for your graph, try `optimize_graph_edit_distance`
and/or `optimize_edit_paths`.

At the same time, I encourage capable people to investigate
alternative GED algorithms, in order to improve the choices available.

        should be considered equal during matching.

        The function will be called like

           edge_match(G1[u1][v1], G2[u2][v2]).

        That is, the function will receive the edge attribute
        dictionaries of the edges under consideration.

        Ignored if edge_subst_cost is specified.  If neither

        attributes are not considered.

    node_subst_cost, node_del_cost, node_ins_cost : callable

        That is, the functions will receive the node attribute
        dictionaries as inputs.  The functions are expected to return
        positive numeric values.

        Function node_subst_cost overrides node_match if specified.
        If neither node_match nor node_subst_cost are specified then
        default node substitution cost of 0 is used (node attributes
        are not considered during matching).

    roots : 2-tuple
        Tuple where first element is a node in G1 and the second
        is a node in G2.
        These nodes are forced to be matched in the comparison to
        allow comparison between rooted graphs.

        Maximum edit distance to consider.  Return None if no edit
        distance under or equal to upper_bound exists.

         transformations between `G1` and `G2`. ``(None, (u2,v2))`` for insertion
         and ``((u1,v1), None)`` for deletion.

    cost : numeric
        Optimal edit path cost (graph edit distance). When the cost
        is zero, it indicates that `G1` and `G2` are isomorphic.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G1 = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> G2 = nx.wheel_graph(5)
    >>> paths, cost = nx.optimal_edit_paths(G1, G2)

    40
    >>> cost
    5.0

    Notes
    -----
    To transform `G1` into a graph isomorphic to `G2`, apply the node
    and edge edits in the returned ``edit_paths``.
    In the case of isomorphic graphs, the cost is zero, and the paths
    represent different isomorphic mappings (isomorphisms). That is, the
    edits involve renaming nodes and edges to match the structure of `G2`.

        decreasing cost.  Otherwise, return all edit paths of cost
        less than or equal to the previous minimum cost.

    roots : 2-tuple
        Tuple where first element is a node in G1 and the second
        is a node in G2.
        These nodes are forced to be matched in the comparison to
        allow comparison between rooted graphs.

    timeout : numeric
        Maximum number of seconds to execute.
        After timeout is met, the current best GED is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    Generator of tuples (node_edit_path, edge_edit_path, cost)
        node_edit_path : list of tuples (u, v)
        edge_edit_path : list of tuples ((u1, v1), (u2, v2))

    Returns the SimRank similarity of nodes in the graph ``G``.

    SimRank is a similarity metric that says "two objects are considered
    to be similar if they are referenced by similar objects." [1]_.

    The pseudo-code definition from the paper is::

        def simrank(G, u, v):
            in_neighbors_u = G.predecessors(u)
            in_neighbors_v = G.predecessors(v)
            scale = C / (len(in_neighbors_u) * len(in_neighbors_v))
            return scale * sum(
                simrank(G, w, x) for w, x in product(in_neighbors_u, in_neighbors_v)
            )

    where ``G`` is the graph, ``u`` is the source, ``v`` is the target,
    and ``C`` is a float decay or importance factor between 0 and 1.

    The SimRank algorithm for determining node similarity is defined in
    [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A NetworkX graph

    source : node
        If this is specified, the returned dictionary maps each node
        ``v`` in the graph to the similarity between ``source`` and
        ``v``.

    target : node
        If both ``source`` and ``target`` are specified, the similarity
        value between ``source`` and ``target`` is returned. If
        ``target`` is specified but ``source`` is not, this argument is
        ignored.

    importance_factor : float
        The relative importance of indirect neighbors with respect to
        direct neighbors.

    max_iterations : integer
        Maximum number of iterations.

    tolerance : float
        Error tolerance used to check convergence. When an iteration of
        the algorithm finds that no similarity value changes more than
        this amount, the algorithm halts.

    Returns
    -------
    similarity : dictionary or float
        If ``source`` and ``target`` are both ``None``, this returns a
        dictionary of dictionaries, where keys are node pairs and value
        are similarity of the pair of nodes.

        If ``source`` is not ``None`` but ``target`` is, this returns a
        dictionary mapping node to the similarity of ``source`` and that
        node.

        If neither ``source`` nor ``target`` is ``None``, this returns
        the similarity value for the given pair of nodes.

    Raises
    ------
    ExceededMaxIterations
        If the algorithm does not converge within ``max_iterations``.

    NodeNotFound
        If either ``source`` or ``target`` is not in `G`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(2)
    >>> nx.simrank_similarity(G)
    {0: {0: 1.0, 1: 0.0}, 1: {0: 0.0, 1: 1.0}}
    >>> nx.simrank_similarity(G, source=0)
    {0: 1.0, 1: 0.0}
    >>> nx.simrank_similarity(G, source=0, target=0)
    1.0

    The result of this function can be converted to a numpy array
    representing the SimRank matrix by using the node order of the
    graph to determine which row and column represent each node.
    Other ordering of nodes is also possible.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> sim = nx.simrank_similarity(G)
    >>> np.array([[sim[u][v] for v in G] for u in G])
    array([[1., 0.],
           [0., 1.]])
    >>> sim_1d = nx.simrank_similarity(G, source=0)
    >>> np.array([sim[0][v] for v in G])
    array([1., 0.])

    Returns the Panther similarity of nodes in the graph `G` to node ``v``.

    Panther is a similarity metric that says "two objects are considered
    to be similar if they frequently appear on the same paths." [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A NetworkX graph
    source : node
        Source node for which to find the top `k` similar other nodes
    k : int (default = 5)
        The number of most similar nodes to return.
    path_length : int (default = 5)
        How long the randomly generated paths should be (``T`` in [1]_)
    c : float (default = 0.5)
        A universal constant that controls the number of random paths to generate.
        Higher values increase the number of sample paths and potentially improve
        accuracy at the cost of more computation. Defaults to 0.5 as recommended
        in [1]_.
    delta : float (default = 0.1)
        The probability that the similarity $S$ is not an epsilon-approximation to (R, phi),
        where $R$ is the number of random paths and $\phi$ is the probability
        that an element sampled from a set $A \subseteq D$, where $D$ is the domain.
    eps : float or None (default = None)
        The error bound for similarity approximation. This controls the accuracy
        of the sampled paths in representing the true similarity. Smaller values
        yield more accurate results but require more sample paths. If `None`, a
        value of ``sqrt(1/|E|)`` is used, which the authors found empirically
        effective.
    weight : string or None, optional (default="weight")
        The name of an edge attribute that holds the numerical value
        used as a weight. If None then each edge has weight 1.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    similarity : dictionary
        Dictionary of nodes to similarity scores (as floats). Note:
        the self-similarity (i.e., ``v``) will not be included in
        the returned dictionary. So, for ``k = 5``, a dictionary of
        top 4 nodes and their similarity scores will be returned.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXUnfeasible
        If `source` is an isolated node.

    NodeNotFound
        If `source` is not in `G`.

    Notes
    -----
        The isolated nodes in `G` are ignored.

    --------
    >>> G = nx.star_graph(10)
    >>> sim = nx.panther_similarity(G, 0)

    Returns the Panther vector similarity (Panther++) of nodes in `G`.

    Computes similarity between nodes based on the "Panther++" algorithm [1]_, which extends
    the basic Panther algorithm by using feature vectors to better capture structural
    similarity.

    While basic Panther similarity measures how often two nodes appear on the same paths,
    Panther vector similarity (Panther++) creates a ``D``-dimensional feature vector for each
    node using its top similarity scores with other nodes, then computes similarity based
    on the Euclidean distance between these feature vectors. This approach better captures
    structural similarity and addresses the bias towards close neighbors present in
    the original Panther algorithm.

    This approach is preferred when:

    1. You need better structural similarity than basic path co-occurrence
    2. You want to overcome the close-neighbor bias of standard Panther
    3. You're working with large graphs where k-d tree indexing would be beneficial
    4. Graph edit distance-like similarity is more appropriate than path co-occurrence

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A NetworkX graph
    source : node
        Source node for which to find the top ``k`` similar other nodes
    D : int
        The number of similarity scores to use (in descending order)
        for each feature vector. Defaults to 10. Note that the original paper
        used D=50 [1]_, but KDTree is optimized for lower dimensions.
    k : int
        The number of most similar nodes to return
    path_length : int
        How long the randomly generated paths should be (``T`` in [1]_)
    c : float
        A universal constant that controls the number of random paths to generate.
        Higher values increase the number of sample paths and potentially improve
        accuracy at the cost of more computation. Defaults to 0.5 as recommended
        in [1]_.
    delta : float
        The probability that ``S`` is not an epsilon-approximation to (R, phi)

        of the sampled paths in representing the true similarity. Smaller values
        yield more accurate results but require more sample paths. If None, a
        value of ``sqrt(1/|E|)`` is used, which the authors found empirically

    weight : string or None, optional (default="weight")
        The name of an edge attribute that holds the numerical value
        used as a weight. If `None` then each edge has weight 1.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    similarity : dict
        Dict of nodes to similarity scores (as floats).
        Note: the self-similarity (i.e., `node`) is not included in the dict.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.star_graph(100)

    The "hub" node is distinct from the "spoke" nodes

    >>> from pprint import pprint
    >>> pprint(nx.panther_vector_similarity(G, source=0, seed=42))
    {35: 0.10402634656233918,
     61: 0.10434063328712018,
     65: 0.10401247833456054,
     85: 0.10506718868571752,
     88: 0.10402634656233918}

    But "spoke" nodes are similar to one another

    >>> result = nx.panther_vector_similarity(G, source=1, seed=42)
    >>> len(result)
    5
    >>> all(similarity == 1.0 for similarity in result.values())
    True

    Notes
    -----
    Results may be nondeterministic when feature vectors have the same distances,
    as the KDTree's internal tie-breaking behavior can vary between runs.
    Using the same ``seed`` parameter ensures reproducible results.
