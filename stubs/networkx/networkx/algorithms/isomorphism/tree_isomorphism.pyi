"""
An algorithm for finding if two undirected trees are isomorphic,
and if so returns an isomorphism between the two sets of nodes.

This algorithm uses a routine to tell if two rooted trees (trees with a
specified root node) are isomorphic, which may be independently useful.

This implements an algorithm from:

    Return an isomorphic mapping between two trees `t1` and `t2`.

    If `t1` and `t2` are not isomorphic, an empty list is returned.
    Note that two trees may have more than one isomorphism, and this routine just
    returns one valid mapping.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t1 : undirected NetworkX graph
        One of the trees being compared

    t2 : undirected NetworkX graph
        The other tree being compared

    Returns
    -------
    isomorphism : list
        A list of pairs in which the left element is a node in `t1`
        and the right element is a node in `t2`.  The pairs are in
        arbitrary order.  If the nodes in one tree is mapped to the names in
        the other, then trees will be identical. Note that an isomorphism
        will not necessarily be unique.

        If `t1` and `t2` are not isomorphic, then it returns the empty list.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If either `t1` or `t2` is not a tree

    Notes
    -----
    This runs in ``O(n*log(n))`` time for trees with ``n`` nodes.
