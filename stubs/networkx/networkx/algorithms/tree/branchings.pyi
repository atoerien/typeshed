    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
        The directed graph.
    attr : str
        The attribute to use as weights. If None, then each edge will be
        treated equally with a weight of 1.

    Returns a branching obtained through a greedy algorithm.

    This algorithm is wrong, and cannot give a proper optimal branching.
    However, we include it for pedagogical reasons, as it can be helpful to
    see what its outputs are.

    The output is a branching, and possibly, a spanning arborescence. However,
    it is not guaranteed to be optimal in either case.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
        The directed graph to scan.
    attr : str

    kind : str
        The type of optimum to search for: 'min' or 'max' greedy branching.

    Returns a minimal branching from `G`.

    A minimal branching is a branching similar to a minimal arborescence but
    without the requirement that the result is actually a spanning arborescence.

    have arborescence (such as multiple components).

    Iterate over all spanning arborescences of a graph in either increasing or

    Notes
    -----
    This iterator uses the partition scheme from [1]_ (included edges,
    excluded edges and open edges). It generates minimum spanning
    arborescences using a modified Edmonds' Algorithm which respects the
    partition of edges. For arborescences with the same weight, ties are
    broken arbitrarily.
