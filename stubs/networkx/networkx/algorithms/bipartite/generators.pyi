    Returns the complete bipartite graph `K_{n_1,n_2}`.

    The graph is composed of two partitions with nodes 0 to (n1 - 1)
    in the first and nodes n1 to (n1 + n2 - 1) in the second.
    Each node in the first is connected to each node in the second.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n1, n2 : integer or iterable container of nodes
        If integers, nodes are from `range(n1)` and `range(n1, n1 + n2)`.
        If a container, the elements are the nodes.
    create_using : NetworkX graph instance, (default: nx.Graph)

    Notes
    -----
    Nodes are the integers 0 to `n1 + n2 - 1` unless either n1 or n2 are
    containers of nodes. If only one of n1 or n2 are integers, that
    integer is replaced by `range` of that integer.

    The nodes are assigned the attribute 'bipartite' with the value 0 or 1
    to indicate which bipartite set the node belongs to.
