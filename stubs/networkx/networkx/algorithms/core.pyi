Find the k-cores of a graph.

The k-core is found by recursively pruning nodes with degrees less than k.

Generalized Cores

https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0202039

For directed graphs a more general notion is that of D-cores which
looks at (k, l) restrictions on (in, out) degree. The (k, k) D-core
is the k-core.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    K-trusses were originally defined in [2] which states that the k-truss
    is the maximal induced subgraph where each edge belongs to at least
    `k-2` triangles. A more recent paper, [1], uses a slightly different
    definition requiring that each edge belong to at least `k` triangles.
    This implementation uses the original definition of `k-2` triangles.
