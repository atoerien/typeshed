    Compute shortest paths in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node, optional
        Starting node for path. If not specified, compute shortest
        paths for each possible starting node.

    target : node, optional
        Ending node for path. If not specified, compute shortest
        paths to all possible nodes.

    weight : None, string or function, optional (default = None)
        If None, every edge has weight/distance/cost 1.
        If a string, use this edge attribute as the edge weight.
        Any edge attribute not present defaults to 1.
        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly
        three positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and
        the dictionary of edge attributes for that edge.
        The function must return a number.

    method : string, optional (default = 'dijkstra')
        The algorithm to use to compute the path.
        Supported options: 'dijkstra', 'bellman-ford'.
        Other inputs produce a ValueError.
        If `weight` is None, unweighted graph methods are used, and this
        suggestion is ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    path: list or dictionary or iterator
        All returned paths include both the source and target in the path.

        If the source and target are both specified, return a single list
        of nodes in a shortest path from the source to the target.

        If only the source is specified, return a dictionary keyed by
        targets with a list of nodes in a shortest path from the source
        to one of the targets.

        If only the target is specified, return a dictionary keyed by
        sources with a list of nodes in a shortest path from one of the
        sources to the target.

        If neither the source nor target are specified, return an iterator
        over (source, dictionary) where dictionary is keyed by target to
        list of nodes in a shortest path from the source to the target.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
        If `source` is not in `G`.

    ValueError
        If `method` is not among the supported options.

    NetworkXNoPath
       If `source` and `target` are specified but no path exists between them.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> print(nx.shortest_path(G, source=0, target=4))
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node, optional
        Starting node for path.
        If not specified, compute shortest path lengths using all nodes as
        source nodes.

    target : node, optional
        Ending node for path.
        If not specified, compute shortest path lengths using all nodes as

    weight : None, string or function, optional (default = None)
        If None, every edge has weight/distance/cost 1.
        If a string, use this edge attribute as the edge weight.
        Any edge attribute not present defaults to 1.
        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value

        the dictionary of edge attributes for that edge.
        The function must return a number.

    method : string, optional (default = 'dijkstra')
        The algorithm to use to compute the path length.
        Supported options: 'dijkstra', 'bellman-ford'.
        Other inputs produce a ValueError.
        If `weight` is None, unweighted graph methods are used, and this

    Returns
    -------
    length: number or iterator
        If the source and target are both specified, return the length of
        the shortest path from the source to the target.

        If only the source is specified, return a dict keyed by target
        to the shortest path length from the source to that target.

        If only the target is specified, return a dict keyed by source
        to the shortest path length from that source to the target.

        If neither the source nor target are specified, return an iterator
        over (source, dictionary) where dictionary is keyed by target to
        shortest path length from source to that target.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
        If `source` is not in `G`.

    NetworkXNoPath
        If no path exists between source and target.

    ValueError
        If `method` is not among the supported options.

    NetworkXPointlessConcept
