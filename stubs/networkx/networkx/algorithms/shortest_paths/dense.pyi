    Find all-pairs shortest path lengths using Floyd's algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    weight: string, optional (default= 'weight')
       Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight.

    Returns
    -------
    predecessor,distance : dictionaries
       Dictionaries, keyed by source and target, of predecessors and distances
       in the shortest path.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G.add_weighted_edges_from(
    ...     [
    ...         ("s", "u", 10),

    Notes
    -----
    Floyd's algorithm is appropriate for finding shortest paths
    in dense graphs or graphs with negative weights when Dijkstra's algorithm
    fails.  This algorithm can still fail if there are negative cycles.
    It has running time $O(n^3)$ with running space of $O(n^2)$.

    """
    Reconstruct a path from source to target using the predecessors
    dict as returned by floyd_warshall_predecessor_and_distance

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : node
