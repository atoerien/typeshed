"""
Routines to find the boundary of a set of nodes.

An edge boundary is a set of edges, each of which has exactly one
endpoint in a given set of nodes (or, in the case of directed graphs,
the set of edges whose source node is in the set).

A node boundary of a set *S* of nodes is the set of (out-)neighbors of
nodes in *S* that are outside *S*.
