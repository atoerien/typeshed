def triadic_census(G: DiGraph[_Node], nodelist: Collection[_Node] | None = None) -> dict[str, int]:
    """
    Determines the triadic census of a directed graph.

    The triadic census is a count of how many of the 16 possible types of
    triads are present in a directed graph. If a list of nodes is passed, then
    only those triads are taken into account which have elements of nodelist in them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : digraph
       A NetworkX DiGraph
    nodelist : list
        List of nodes for which you want to calculate triadic census

    Returns
    -------
    census : dict
       Dictionary with triad type as keys and number of occurrences as values.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2)])
    >>> triadic_census = nx.triadic_census(G)
    >>> for key, value in triadic_census.items():
    ...     print(f"{key}: {value}")
    003: 0
    012: 0
    102: 0
    021D: 0
    021U: 0
    021C: 0
    111D: 0
    111U: 0
    030T: 2
    030C: 2
    201: 0
    120D: 0
    120U: 0
    120C: 0
    210: 0
    300: 0

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm has complexity $O(m)$ where $m$ is the number of edges in
    the graph.

    For undirected graphs, the triadic census can be computed by first converting
    the graph into a directed graph using the ``G.to_directed()`` method.
    After this conversion, only the triad types 003, 102, 201 and 300 will be
    present in the undirected scenario.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `nodelist` contains duplicate nodes or nodes not in `G`.
        If you want to ignore this you can preprocess with `set(nodelist) & G.nodes`

    Returns a list of all triads for each triad type in a directed graph.
    There are exactly 16 different types of triads possible. Suppose 1, 2, 3 are three
    nodes, they will be classified as a particular triad type if their connections
    are as follows:

    - 003: 1, 2, 3

def triad_type(G: DiGraph[_Node]) -> str | None:
    """
    Returns the sociological triad type for a triad.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : digraph
       A NetworkX DiGraph with 3 nodes

    Returns
    -------
    triad_type : str
       A string identifying the triad type

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)])
    >>> nx.triad_type(G)
    '030C'
    >>> G.add_edge(1, 3)

    '120C'

    Notes
    -----
    There can be 6 unique edges in a triad (order-3 DiGraph) (so 2^^6=64 unique
    triads given 3 nodes). These 64 triads each display exactly 1 of 16
    topologies of triads (topologies can be permuted). These topologies are
    identified by the following notation:

    {m}{a}{n}{type} (for example: 111D, 210, 102)

    Here:

    {m}     = number of mutual ties (takes 0, 1, 2, 3); a mutual tie is (0,1)
              AND (1,0)
    {a}     = number of asymmetric ties (takes 0, 1, 2, 3); an asymmetric tie
              is (0,1) BUT NOT (1,0) or vice versa
    {n}     = number of null ties (takes 0, 1, 2, 3); a null tie is NEITHER
              (0,1) NOR (1,0)
    {type}  = a letter (takes U, D, C, T) corresponding to up, down, cyclical
              and transitive. This is only used for topologies that can have
              more than one form (eg: 021D and 021U).
