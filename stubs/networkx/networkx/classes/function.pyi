def induced_subgraph(G: Graph[_Node], nbunch: _NBunch[_Node]) -> Graph[_Node]:

    Returns a SubGraph view of `G` showing only nodes in nbunch.

    The induced subgraph of a graph on a set of nodes N is the
    graph with nodes N and edges from G which have both ends in N.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
    nbunch : node, container of nodes or None (for all nodes)

    Returns
    -------
    subgraph : SubGraph View
        A read-only view of the subgraph in `G` induced by the nodes.
        Changes to the graph `G` will be reflected in the view.

    Notes
    -----
    To create a mutable subgraph with its own copies of nodes
    edges and attributes use `subgraph.copy()` or `Graph(subgraph)`

    For an inplace reduction of a graph to a subgraph you can remove nodes:
    `G.remove_nodes_from(n in G if n not in set(nbunch))`

    If you are going to compute subgraphs of your subgraphs you could
    end up with a chain of views that can be very slow once the chain
    has about 15 views in it. If they are all induced subgraphs, you
    can short-cut the chain by making them all subgraphs of the original
    graph. The graph class method `G.subgraph` does this when `G` is
    a subgraph. In contrast, this function allows you to choose to build
    chains or not, as you wish. The returned subgraph is a view on `G`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)  # or DiGraph, MultiGraph, MultiDiGraph, etc
    >>> H = nx.induced_subgraph(G, [0, 1, 3])

    """
    ...
def edge_subgraph(G: Graph[_Node], edges):
    """
    Returns a view of the subgraph induced by the specified edges.

    The induced subgraph contains each edge in `edges` and each
    node incident to any of those edges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
    edges : iterable
        An iterable of edges. Edges not present in `G` are ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    subgraph : SubGraph View
        A read-only edge-induced subgraph of `G`.
        Changes to `G` are reflected in the view.

    Notes
    -----
    To create a mutable subgraph with its own copies of nodes
    edges and attributes use `subgraph.copy()` or `Graph(subgraph)`

    If you create a subgraph of a subgraph recursively you can end up
    with a chain of subgraphs that becomes very slow with about 15
    nested subgraph views. Luckily the edge_subgraph filter nests
    nicely so you can use the original graph as G in this function
    to avoid chains. We do not rule out chains programmatically so
    that odd cases like an `edge_subgraph` of a `restricted_view`
    can be created.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> H = G.edge_subgraph([(0, 1), (3, 4)])

def restricted_view(G: Graph[_Node], nodes, edges):
    """
    Returns a view of `G` with hidden nodes and edges.

    The resulting subgraph filters out node `nodes` and edges `edges`.
    Filtered out nodes also filter out any of their edges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
    nodes : iterable
        An iterable of nodes. Nodes not present in `G` are ignored.
    edges : iterable
        An iterable of edges. Edges not present in `G` are ignored.

    subgraph : SubGraph View
        A read-only restricted view of `G` filtering out nodes and edges.
        Changes to `G` are reflected in the view.

    Notes
    -----
    To create a mutable subgraph with its own copies of nodes
    edges and attributes use `subgraph.copy()` or `Graph(subgraph)`

    If you create a subgraph of a subgraph recursively you may end up
    with a chain of subgraph views. Such chains can get quite slow
    for lengths near 15. To avoid long chains, try to make your subgraph
    based on the original graph.  We do not rule out chains programmatically

    values : scalar value, dict-like

    Examples

        >>> G.nodes[1]["labels"]
        ['foo']
        >>> G.nodes[2]["labels"]
        ['foo']

    If you provide a dictionary of dictionaries as the second argument,
    the outer dictionary is assumed to be keyed by node to an inner
    dictionary of node attributes for that node::

        >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)

    Sets edge attributes from a given value or dictionary of values.

    .. Warning:: The call order of arguments `values` and `name`
        switched between v1.x & v2.x.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph

    values : scalar value, dict-like
        What the edge attribute should be set to.  If `values` is
        not a dictionary, then it is treated as a single attribute value
        that is then applied to every edge in `G`.  This means that if
        you provide a mutable object, like a list, updates to that object
        will be reflected in the edge attribute for each edge.  The attribute
        name will be `name`.

        If `values` is a dict or a dict of dict, it should be keyed
        by edge tuple to either an attribute value or a dict of attribute
        key/value pairs used to update the edge's attributes.
        For multigraphs, the edge tuples must be of the form ``(u, v, key)``,
        where `u` and `v` are nodes and `key` is the edge key.
        For non-multigraphs, the keys must be tuples of the form ``(u, v)``.

    name : string (optional, default=None)
        Name of the edge attribute to set if values is a scalar.

    Examples
    --------
    After computing some property of the edges of a graph, you may want
    to assign a edge attribute to store the value of that property for
    each edge::

        >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)
        >>> bb = nx.edge_betweenness_centrality(G, normalized=False)
        >>> nx.set_edge_attributes(G, bb, "betweenness")
        >>> G.edges[1, 2]["betweenness"]
        2.0

    If you provide a list as the second argument, updates to the list
    will be reflected in the edge attribute for each edge::

        >>> labels = []
        >>> nx.set_edge_attributes(G, labels, "labels")
        >>> labels.append("foo")
        >>> G.edges[0, 1]["labels"]
        ['foo']
        >>> G.edges[1, 2]["labels"]
        ['foo']

    If you provide a dictionary of dictionaries as the second argument,
    the entire dictionary will be used to update edge attributes::

        >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)
        >>> attrs = {(0, 1): {"attr1": 20, "attr2": "nothing"}, (1, 2): {"attr2": 3}}
        >>> nx.set_edge_attributes(G, attrs)
        >>> G[0][1]["attr1"]
        20
        >>> G[0][1]["attr2"]
        'nothing'
        >>> G[1][2]["attr2"]
        3

    The attributes of one Graph can be used to set those of another.

        >>> H = nx.path_graph(3)
        >>> nx.set_edge_attributes(H, G.edges)

    Note that if the dict contains edges that are not in `G`, they are
    silently ignored::

        >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1)])
        >>> nx.set_edge_attributes(G, {(1, 2): {"weight": 2.0}})
        >>> (1, 2) in G.edges()
        False

    For multigraphs, the `values` dict is expected to be keyed by 3-tuples
    including the edge key::

        >>> MG = nx.MultiGraph()
        >>> edges = [(0, 1), (0, 1)]
        >>> MG.add_edges_from(edges)  # Returns list of edge keys
        [0, 1]
        >>> attributes = {(0, 1, 0): {"cost": 21}, (0, 1, 1): {"cost": 7}}
        >>> nx.set_edge_attributes(MG, attributes)
        >>> MG[0][1][0]["cost"]
        21
        >>> MG[0][1][1]["cost"]
        7

    If MultiGraph attributes are desired for a Graph, you must convert the 3-tuple
    multiedge to a 2-tuple edge and the last multiedge's attribute value will
    overwrite the previous values. Continuing from the previous case we get::

        >>> H = nx.path_graph([0, 1, 2])
        >>> nx.set_edge_attributes(H, {(u, v): ed for u, v, ed in MG.edges.data()})
