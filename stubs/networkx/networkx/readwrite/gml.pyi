Read graphs in GML format.

"GML, the Graph Modelling Language, is our proposal for a portable
file format for graphs. GML's key features are portability, simple
syntax, extensibility and flexibility. A GML file consists of a
hierarchical key-value lists. Graphs can be annotated with arbitrary
data structures. The idea for a common file format was born at the
GD'95; this proposal is the outcome of many discussions. GML is the
standard file format in the Graphlet graph editor system. It has been
overtaken and adapted by several other systems for drawing graphs."

GML files are stored using a 7-bit ASCII encoding with any extended
ASCII characters (iso8859-1) appearing as HTML character entities.
You will need to give some thought into how the exported data should
interact with different languages and even different Python versions.
Re-importing from gml is also a concern.

Without specifying a `stringizer`/`destringizer`, the code is capable of
writing `int`/`float`/`str`/`dict`/`list` data as required by the GML
specification.  For writing other data types, and for reading data other
than `str` you need to explicitly supply a `stringizer`/`destringizer`.

For additional documentation on the GML file format, please see the
`GML website <https://web.archive.org/web/20190207140002/http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/index.php?id=17297&L=1>`_.

Several example graphs in GML format may be found on Mark Newman's
`Network data page <http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/>`_.

    Read graph in GML format from `path`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : file or string
        Filename or file handle to read.
        Filenames ending in .gz or .bz2 will be decompressed.

    label : string, optional
        If not None, the parsed nodes will be renamed according to node
        attributes indicated by `label`. Default value: 'label'.

    destringizer : callable, optional
        A `destringizer` that recovers values stored as strings in GML. If it
        cannot convert a string to a value, a `ValueError` is raised. Default
        value : None.

    -------
    G : NetworkX graph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError

    See the module docstring :mod:`networkx.readwrite.gml` for more details.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
    >>> nx.write_gml(G, "test_path4.gml")

    GML values are interpreted as strings by default:

    >>> H = nx.read_gml("test_path4.gml")
    >>> H.nodes
    NodeView(('0', '1', '2', '3'))

    When a `destringizer` is provided, GML values are converted to the provided type.
    For example, integer nodes can be recovered as shown below:

    >>> J = nx.read_gml("test_path4.gml", destringizer=int)
    >>> J.nodes
    NodeView((0, 1, 2, 3))
