Functions for reading and writing graphs in the *graph6* format.

The *graph6* file format is suitable for small graphs or large dense
graphs. For large sparse graphs, use the *sparse6* format.

For more information, see the `graph6`_ homepage.

    """
    Read a simple undirected graph in graph6 format from bytes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bytes_in : bytes
       Data in graph6 format

    Returns
    -------
    G : Graph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `bytes_in` is unable to be parsed in graph6 format

    ValueError
        If any character ``c`` in bytes_in does not satisfy
        ``63 <= ord(c) < 127``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.from_graph6_bytes(b"A_")
    >>> sorted(G.edges())
    [(0, 1)]

    Notes
    -----
    Per the graph6 spec, the header (e.g. ``b'>>graph6<<'``) must not be
    followed by a newline character.

def to_graph6_bytes(G: Graph[_Node], nodes: Iterable[Incomplete] | None = None, header: bool = True):
    r"""
    Convert a simple undirected graph to bytes in graph6 format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : Graph (undirected)

    nodes: list or iterable
       Nodes are labeled 0...n-1 in the order provided.  If None the ordering
       given by ``G.nodes()`` is used.

    header: bool
       If True add '>>graph6<<' bytes to head of data.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the graph is directed or is a multigraph.

    ValueError
        If the graph has at least ``2 ** 36`` nodes; the graph6 format
        is only defined for graphs of order less than ``2 ** 36``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> nx.to_graph6_bytes(nx.path_graph(2))
    b'>>graph6<<A_\n'

    See Also
    --------
    from_graph6_bytes, read_graph6, write_graph6_bytes

    Notes
    -----
    The returned bytes end with a newline character.

    The format does not support edge or node labels, parallel edges or
    self loops. If self loops are present they are silently ignored.

def read_graph6(path: StrPath | SupportsRead[bytes]) -> Graph[Incomplete]:
    r"""
    Read simple undirected graphs in graph6 format from path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : file or string
       Filename or file handle to read.
       Filenames ending in .gz or .bz2 will be decompressed.

    Returns
    -------
    G : Graph or list of Graphs
       If the file contains multiple lines then a list of graphs is returned

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the string is unable to be parsed in graph6 format

    Examples
    --------
    You can read a graph6 file by giving the path to the file::

        >>> import tempfile
        >>> with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as f:
        ...     _ = f.write(b">>graph6<<A_\n")

        ...     G = nx.read_graph6(f.name)
        >>> list(G.edges())
        [(0, 1)]

    You can also read a graph6 file by giving an open file-like object::

        >>> import tempfile
        >>> with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as f:
        ...     _ = f.write(b">>graph6<<A_\n")
