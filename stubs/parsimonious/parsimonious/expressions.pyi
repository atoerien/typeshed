    Turn a plain callable into an Expression.

    The callable can be of this simple form::

        def foo(text, pos):
            '''If this custom expression matches starting at text[pos], return
            the index where it stops matching. Otherwise, return None.'''

    If your callable needs to make sub-calls to other rules in the grammar or
    do error reporting, it can take this form, gaining additional arguments::

    The return value of the callable, if an int or a tuple, will be
    automatically transmuted into a :class:`~parsimonious.Node`. If it returns
    a Node-like class directly, it will be passed through unchanged.
