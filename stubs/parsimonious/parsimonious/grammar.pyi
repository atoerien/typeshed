class Grammar(OrderedDict[str, Expression]):
    """
    A collection of rules that describe a language

    You can start parsing from the default rule by calling ``parse()``
    directly on the ``Grammar`` object::

        g = Grammar('''
                    polite_greeting = greeting ", my good " title
                    greeting        = "Hi" / "Hello"

                    ''')
        g.parse('Hello, my good sir')

    Or start parsing from any of the other rules; you can pull them out of the
    grammar as if it were a dictionary::

        g['title'].parse('sir')

    You could also just construct a bunch of ``Expression`` objects yourself
    and stitch them together into a language, but using a ``Grammar`` has some
    important advantages:

    * Languages are much easier to define in the nice syntax it provides.
    * Circular references aren't a pain.
    * It does all kinds of whizzy space- and time-saving optimizations, like
      factoring up repeated subexpressions into a single object, which should
      increase cache hit ratio. [Is this implemented yet?]
