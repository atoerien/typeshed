        setopt(option, value) -> None

        Set curl session option. Corresponds to `curl_easy_setopt`_ in libcurl.

        *option* specifies which option to set. PycURL defines constants
        corresponding to ``CURLOPT_*`` constants in libcurl, except that
        the ``CURLOPT_`` prefix is removed. For example, ``CURLOPT_URL`` is
        exposed in PycURL as ``pycurl.URL``, with some exceptions as detailed below.
        For convenience, ``CURLOPT_*``
        constants are also exposed on the Curl objects themselves::

            import pycurl
            c = pycurl.Curl()
            c.setopt(pycurl.URL, "http://www.python.org/")
            # Same as:
            c.setopt(c.URL, "http://www.python.org/")

        The following are exceptions to option constant naming convention:

        - ``CURLOPT_FILETIME`` is mapped as ``pycurl.OPT_FILETIME``
        - ``CURLOPT_CERTINFO`` is mapped as ``pycurl.OPT_CERTINFO``
        - ``CURLOPT_COOKIELIST`` is mapped as ``pycurl.COOKIELIST``
          and, as of PycURL 7.43.0.2, also as ``pycurl.OPT_COOKIELIST``
        - ``CURLOPT_RTSP_CLIENT_CSEQ`` is mapped as ``pycurl.OPT_RTSP_CLIENT_CSEQ``
        - ``CURLOPT_RTSP_REQUEST`` is mapped as ``pycurl.OPT_RTSP_REQUEST``
        - ``CURLOPT_RTSP_SERVER_CSEQ`` is mapped as ``pycurl.OPT_RTSP_SERVER_CSEQ``
        - ``CURLOPT_RTSP_SESSION_ID`` is mapped as ``pycurl.OPT_RTSP_SESSION_ID``
        - ``CURLOPT_RTSP_STREAM_URI`` is mapped as ``pycurl.OPT_RTSP_STREAM_URI``
        - ``CURLOPT_RTSP_TRANSPORT`` is mapped as ``pycurl.OPT_RTSP_TRANSPORT``

        *value* specifies the value to set the option to. Different options accept
        values of different types:

        - Options specified by `curl_easy_setopt`_ as accepting ``1`` or an
          integer value accept Python integers, long integers (on Python 2.x) and
          booleans::

            c.setopt(pycurl.FOLLOWLOCATION, True)
            c.setopt(pycurl.FOLLOWLOCATION, 1)
            # Python 2.x only:
            c.setopt(pycurl.FOLLOWLOCATION, 1L)

        - Options specified as accepting strings by ``curl_easy_setopt`` accept
          byte strings (``str`` on Python 2, ``bytes`` on Python 3) and
          Unicode strings with ASCII code points only.
          For more information, please refer to :ref:`unicode`. Example::

            c.setopt(pycurl.URL, "http://www.python.org/")
            c.setopt(pycurl.URL, u"http://www.python.org/")
            # Python 3.x only:
            c.setopt(pycurl.URL, b"http://www.python.org/")

        - ``HTTP200ALIASES``, ``HTTPHEADER``, ``POSTQUOTE``, ``PREQUOTE``,
          ``PROXYHEADER`` and
          ``QUOTE`` accept a list or tuple of strings. The same rules apply to these
          strings as do to string option values. Example::

            c.setopt(pycurl.HTTPHEADER, ["Accept:"])
            c.setopt(pycurl.HTTPHEADER, ("Accept:",))

        - ``READDATA`` accepts a file object or any Python object which has
          a ``read`` method. On Python 2, a file object will be passed directly
          to libcurl and may result in greater transfer efficiency, unless
          PycURL has been compiled with ``AVOID_STDIO`` option.
          On Python 3 and on Python 2 when the value is not a true file object,
          ``READDATA`` is emulated in PycURL via ``READFUNCTION``.
          The file should generally be opened in binary mode. Example::

            f = open('file.txt', 'rb')
            c.setopt(c.READDATA, f)

        - ``WRITEDATA`` and ``WRITEHEADER`` accept a file object or any Python
          object which has a ``write`` method. On Python 2, a file object will
          be passed directly to libcurl and may result in greater transfer efficiency,
          unless PycURL has been compiled with ``AVOID_STDIO`` option.
          On Python 3 and on Python 2 when the value is not a true file object,
          ``WRITEDATA`` is emulated in PycURL via ``WRITEFUNCTION``.
          The file should generally be opened in binary mode. Example::

            f = open('/dev/null', 'wb')
            c.setopt(c.WRITEDATA, f)

        - ``*FUNCTION`` options accept a function. Supported callbacks are documented
          in :ref:`callbacks`. Example::

            # Python 2
            import StringIO
            b = StringIO.StringIO()
            c.setopt(pycurl.WRITEFUNCTION, b.write)

        - ``SHARE`` option accepts a :ref:`curlshareobject`.

        - ``STDERR`` option is not currently supported.

        It is possible to set integer options - and only them - that PycURL does
        not know about by using the numeric value of the option constant directly.
        For example, ``pycurl.VERBOSE`` has the value 42, and may be set as follows::

            c.setopt(42, 1)

        *setopt* can reset some options to their default value, performing the job of
        :py:meth:`pycurl.Curl.unsetopt`, if ``None`` is passed
        for the option value. The following two calls are equivalent::

            c.setopt(c.URL, None)
            c.unsetopt(c.URL)

        Raises TypeError when the option value is not of a type accepted by the
        respective option, and pycurl.error exception when libcurl rejects the
        option or its value.

        ...
    def setopt_string(self, option: int, value: str) -> None:
        """
        setopt_string(option, value) -> None

        Set curl session option to a string value.

        This method allows setting string options that are not officially supported
        by PycURL, for example because they did not exist when the version of PycURL
        being used was released.
        :py:meth:`pycurl.Curl.setopt` should be used for setting options that
        PycURL knows about.

        **Warning:** No checking is performed that *option* does, in fact,
        expect a string value. Using this method incorrectly can crash the program
        and may lead to a security vulnerability.
        Furthermore, it is on the application to ensure that the *value* object
        does not get garbage collected while libcurl is using it.
        libcurl copies most string options but not all; one option whose value
        is not copied by libcurl is `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS`_.

        *option* would generally need to be given as an integer literal rather than
        a symbolic constant.

        *value* can be a binary string or a Unicode string using ASCII code points,
        same as with string options given to PycURL elsewhere.

        Example setting URL via ``setopt_string``::

            import pycurl
            c = pycurl.Curl()
            c.setopt_string(10002, "http://www.python.org/")

        This behavior is identical to :ref:`perform_rb <perform_rb>`.

        On Python 3, this method arranges for response body to be saved in a BytesIO

        thus an encoding error implies the transfer/network operation succeeded.

          On Python 3, the data returned by libcurl is decoded using the

        *option* specifies which option to set. PycURL defines constants
        corresponding to ``CURLMOPT_*`` constants in libcurl, except that
        the ``CURLMOPT_`` prefix is replaced with ``M_`` prefix.
        For example, ``CURLMOPT_PIPELINING`` is
        exposed in PycURL as ``pycurl.M_PIPELINING``. For convenience, ``CURLMOPT_*``
        constants are also exposed on CurlMulti objects::

            # Same as:
            m.setopt(m.M_PIPELINING, 1)

        *value* specifies the value to set the option to. Different options accept
        values of different types:

        - Options specified by `curl_multi_setopt`_ as accepting ``1`` or an
          integer value accept Python integers, long integers (on Python 2.x) and
          booleans::

            m.setopt(pycurl.M_PIPELINING, True)
            m.setopt(pycurl.M_PIPELINING, 1)
            # Python 2.x only:
            m.setopt(pycurl.M_PIPELINING, 1L)

        - ``*FUNCTION`` options accept a function. Supported callbacks are
          ``CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION`` AND ``CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION``. Please refer to
          the PycURL test suite for examples on using the callbacks.

        Raises TypeError when the option value is not of a type accepted by the

        option or its value.
