class Transform(NamedTuple):
    """
    A representation of an affine transformation matrix for 2D shapes.

    The actual matrix is:

    ```
                        [ a b 0 ]
    [x' y' 1] = [x y 1] [ c d 0 ]
                        [ e f 1 ]
    ```

    Complex transformation operations can be composed via a sequence of simple
    transformations by performing successive matrix multiplication of the simple
    transformations.

    For example, scaling a set of points around a specific center point can be
    represented by a translation-scale-translation sequence, where the first
    translation translates the center to the origin, the scale transform scales the
    points relative to the origin, and the second translation translates the points
    back to the specified center point. Transform multiplication is performed using
    python's dedicated matrix multiplication operator, `@`

    The semantics of this representation mean composed transformations are specified
    left-to-right in order of application (some other systems provide transposed
    representations, in which case the application order is right-to-left).

    For example, to rotate the square `(1,1) (1,3) (3,3) (3,1)` 45 degrees clockwise
    about its center point (which is `(2,2)`) , the translate-rotate-translate
    process described above may be applied:

    ```python
    rotate_centered = (
        Transform.translation(-2, -2)
        @ Transform.rotation_d(45)
        @ Transform.translation(2, 2)
    )
    ```

    Instances of this class provide a chaining API, so the above transform could also be
    constructed as follows:

    ```python
    rotate_centered = Transform.translation(-2, -2).rotate_d(45).translate(2, 2)
    ```

    Or, because the particular operation of performing some transformations about a
    specific point is pretty common,

    ```python
    rotate_centered = Transform.rotation_d(45).about(2, 2)
    ```

    By convention, this class provides class method constructors following noun-ish
    naming (`translation`, `scaling`, `rotation`, `shearing`) and instance method
    manipulations following verb-ish naming (`translate`, `scale`, `rotate`, `shear`).
