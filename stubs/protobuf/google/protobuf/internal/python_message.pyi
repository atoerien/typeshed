"""
Contains a metaclass and helper functions used to create
protocol message classes from Descriptor objects at runtime.

Recall that a metaclass is the "type" of a class.
(A class is to a metaclass what an instance is to a class.)

In this case, we use the GeneratedProtocolMessageType metaclass
to inject all the useful functionality into the classes
output by the protocol compiler at compile-time.

The upshot of all this is that the real implementation
details for ALL pure-Python protocol buffers are *here in
this file*.

class GeneratedProtocolMessageType(type):
    """
    Metaclass for protocol message classes created at runtime from Descriptors.

    We add implementations for all methods described in the Message class.  We
    also create properties to allow getting/setting all fields in the protocol
    message.  Finally, we create slots to prevent users from accidentally
    "setting" nonexistent fields in the protocol message, which then wouldn't get
    serialized / deserialized properly.

    The protocol compiler currently uses this metaclass to create protocol
    message classes at runtime.  Clients can also manually create their own
    classes at runtime, as in this example:

    mydescriptor = Descriptor(.....)
    factory = symbol_database.Default()
    factory.pool.AddDescriptor(mydescriptor)
    MyProtoClass = message_factory.GetMessageClass(mydescriptor)
    myproto_instance = MyProtoClass()
    myproto.foo_field = 23

        Custom allocation for runtime-generated class types.

        We override __new__ because this is apparently the only place
        where we can meaningfully set __slots__ on the class we're creating(?).
        (The interplay between metaclasses and slots is not very well-documented).

        Args:
          name: Name of the class (ignored, but required by the
            metaclass protocol).
          bases: Base classes of the class we're constructing.
            (Should be message.Message).  We ignore this field, but
            it's required by the metaclass protocol
          dictionary: The class dictionary of the class we're
            constructing.  dictionary[_DESCRIPTOR_KEY] must contain
            a Descriptor object describing this protocol message
            type.

        Returns:
          Newly-allocated class.
