    This class inherits from :class:`threading.Thread` and supports all its
    methods. It will set :attr:`daemon` to ``True`` when created.

    All callback arguments are optional; a callback may take less arguments
    than actually passed, but not more, unless they are optional.

    :param callable on_press: The callback to call when a button is pressed.

        It will be called with the arguments ``(key, injected)``, where ``key``
        is a :class:`KeyCode`, a :class:`Key` or ``None`` if the key is
        unknown, and ``injected`` whether the event was injected and thus not
        generated by an actual input device.

        Please note that not all backends support ``injected`` and will always
        set it to ``False``.

    :param callable on_release: The callback to call when a button is released.

        It will be called with the arguments ``(key, injected)``, where ``key``
        is a :class:`KeyCode`, a :class:`Key` or ``None`` if the key is
        unknown, and ``injected`` whether the event was injected and thus not
        generated by an actual input device.

        Please note that not all backends support ``injected`` and will always
        set it to ``False``.

    :param bool suppress: Whether to suppress events. Setting this to ``True``
        will prevent the input events from being passed to the rest of the
        system.

    :param kwargs: Any non-standard platform dependent options. These should be
        prefixed with the platform name thus: ``darwin_``, ``uinput_``,
        ``xorg_`` or ``win32_``.

        Supported values are:

        ``darwin_intercept``
            A callable taking the arguments ``(event_type, event)``, where
            ``event_type`` is ``Quartz.kCGEventKeyDown`` or
            ``Quartz.kCGEventKeyUp``, and ``event`` is a ``CGEventRef``.

            This callable can freely modify the event using functions like
            ``Quartz.CGEventSetIntegerValueField``. If this callable does not
            return the event, the event is suppressed system wide.

        ``uinput_device_paths``
            A list of device paths.

            If this is specified, *pynput* will limit the number of devices
            checked for the capabilities needed to those passed, otherwise all
            system devices will be used. Passing this might be required if an
            incorrect device is chosen.

        ``win32_event_filter``
            A callable taking the arguments ``(msg, data)``, where ``msg`` is
            the current message, and ``data`` associated data as a
            `KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-kbdllhookstruct>`_.

            If this callback returns ``False``, the event will not be
            propagated to the listener callback.

            If ``self.suppress_event()`` is called, the event is suppressed
            system wide.
