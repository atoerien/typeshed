    """
    Draw a line plot with possibility of several semantic groupings.

    The relationship between `x` and `y` can be shown for different subsets
    of the data using the `hue`, `size`, and `style` parameters. These
    parameters control what visual semantics are used to identify the different
    subsets. It is possible to show up to three dimensions independently by
    using all three semantic types, but this style of plot can be hard to
    interpret and is often ineffective. Using redundant semantics (i.e. both
    `hue` and `style` for the same variable) can be helpful for making
    graphics more accessible.

    See the :ref:`tutorial <relational_tutorial>` for more information.

    The default treatment of the `hue` (and to a lesser extent, `size`)
    semantic, if present, depends on whether the variable is inferred to
    represent "numeric" or "categorical" data. In particular, numeric variables
    are represented with a sequential colormap by default, and the legend
    entries show regular "ticks" with values that may or may not exist in the
    data. This behavior can be controlled through various parameters, as
    described and illustrated below.

    By default, the plot aggregates over multiple `y` values at each value of
    `x` and shows an estimate of the central tendency and a confidence
    interval for that estimate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`, :class:`numpy.ndarray`, mapping, or sequence
        Input data structure. Either a long-form collection of vectors that can be
        assigned to named variables or a wide-form dataset that will be internally
        reshaped.
    x, y : vectors or keys in ``data``
        Variables that specify positions on the x and y axes.
    hue : vector or key in `data`
        Grouping variable that will produce lines with different colors.
        Can be either categorical or numeric, although color mapping will
        behave differently in latter case.
    size : vector or key in `data`
        Grouping variable that will produce lines with different widths.
        Can be either categorical or numeric, although size mapping will
        behave differently in latter case.
    style : vector or key in `data`
        Grouping variable that will produce lines with different dashes
        and/or markers. Can have a numeric dtype but will always be treated
        as categorical.
    units : vector or key in `data`
        Grouping variable identifying sampling units. When used, a separate
        line will be drawn for each unit with appropriate semantics, but no
        legend entry will be added. Useful for showing distribution of
        experimental replicates when exact identities are not needed.
    weights : vector or key in `data`
        Data values or column used to compute weighted estimation.
        Note that use of weights currently limits the choice of statistics
        to a 'mean' estimator and 'ci' errorbar.
    palette : string, list, dict, or :class:`matplotlib.colors.Colormap`
        Method for choosing the colors to use when mapping the ``hue`` semantic.
        String values are passed to :func:`color_palette`. List or dict values
        imply categorical mapping, while a colormap object implies numeric mapping.
    hue_order : vector of strings
        Specify the order of processing and plotting for categorical levels of the
        ``hue`` semantic.
    hue_norm : tuple or :class:`matplotlib.colors.Normalize`
        Either a pair of values that set the normalization range in data units
        or an object that will map from data units into a [0, 1] interval. Usage
        implies numeric mapping.
    sizes : list, dict, or tuple
        An object that determines how sizes are chosen when `size` is used.
        List or dict arguments should provide a size for each unique data value,
        which forces a categorical interpretation. The argument may also be a
        min, max tuple.
    size_order : list
        Specified order for appearance of the `size` variable levels,
        otherwise they are determined from the data. Not relevant when the
        `size` variable is numeric.
    size_norm : tuple or Normalize object
        Normalization in data units for scaling plot objects when the
        `size` variable is numeric.
    dashes : boolean, list, or dictionary
        Object determining how to draw the lines for different levels of the
        `style` variable. Setting to `True` will use default dash codes, or
        you can pass a list of dash codes or a dictionary mapping levels of the
        `style` variable to dash codes. Setting to `False` will use solid
        lines for all subsets. Dashes are specified as in matplotlib: a tuple
        of `(segment, gap)` lengths, or an empty string to draw a solid line.
    markers : boolean, list, or dictionary
        Object determining how to draw the markers for different levels of the
        `style` variable. Setting to `True` will use default markers, or
        you can pass a list of markers or a dictionary mapping levels of the
        `style` variable to markers. Setting to `False` will draw
        marker-less lines.  Markers are specified as in matplotlib.
    style_order : list
        Specified order for appearance of the `style` variable levels
        otherwise they are determined from the data. Not relevant when the
        `style` variable is numeric.
    estimator : name of pandas method or callable or None
        Method for aggregating across multiple observations of the `y`
        variable at the same `x` level. If `None`, all observations will
        be drawn.
    errorbar : string, (string, number) tuple, or callable
        Name of errorbar method (either "ci", "pi", "se", or "sd"), or a tuple
        with a method name and a level parameter, or a function that maps from a
        vector to a (min, max) interval, or None to hide errorbar. See the
        :doc:`errorbar tutorial </tutorial/error_bars>` for more information.
    n_boot : int
        Number of bootstraps to use for computing the confidence interval.
    seed : int, numpy.random.Generator, or numpy.random.RandomState
        Seed or random number generator for reproducible bootstrapping.
    orient : "x" or "y"
        Dimension along which the data are sorted / aggregated. Equivalently,
        the "independent variable" of the resulting function.
    sort : boolean
        If True, the data will be sorted by the x and y variables, otherwise
        lines will connect points in the order they appear in the dataset.
    err_style : "band" or "bars"
        Whether to draw the confidence intervals with translucent error bands
        or discrete error bars.
    err_kws : dict of keyword arguments
        Additional parameters to control the aesthetics of the error bars. The
        kwargs are passed either to :meth:`matplotlib.axes.Axes.fill_between`
        or :meth:`matplotlib.axes.Axes.errorbar`, depending on `err_style`.
    legend : "auto", "brief", "full", or False
        How to draw the legend. If "brief", numeric `hue` and `size`
        variables will be represented with a sample of evenly spaced values.
        If "full", every group will get an entry in the legend. If "auto",
        choose between brief or full representation based on number of levels.
        If `False`, no legend data is added and no legend is drawn.
    ci : int or "sd" or None
        Size of the confidence interval to draw when aggregating.

        .. deprecated:: 0.12.0
            Use the new `errorbar` parameter for more flexibility.

    ax : :class:`matplotlib.axes.Axes`
        Pre-existing axes for the plot. Otherwise, call :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.gca`
        internally.
    kwargs : key, value mappings
        Other keyword arguments are passed down to
        :meth:`matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot`.
