    Plot data and regression model fits across a FacetGrid.

    This function combines :func:`regplot` and :class:`FacetGrid`. It is
    intended as a convenient interface to fit regression models across
    conditional subsets of a dataset.

    When thinking about how to assign variables to different facets, a general
    rule is that it makes sense to use ``hue`` for the most important
    comparison, followed by ``col`` and ``row``. However, always think about
    your particular dataset and the goals of the visualization you are
    creating.

    There are a number of mutually exclusive options for estimating the
    regression model. See the :ref:`tutorial <regression_tutorial>` for more
    information.    

    The parameters to this function span most of the options in
    :class:`FacetGrid`, although there may be occasional cases where you will
    want to use that class and :func:`regplot` directly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : DataFrame
        Tidy ("long-form") dataframe where each column is a variable and each
        row is an observation.    
    x, y : strings, optional
        Input variables; these should be column names in ``data``.
    hue, col, row : strings
        Variables that define subsets of the data, which will be drawn on
        separate facets in the grid. See the ``*_order`` parameters to control
        the order of levels of this variable.
    palette : palette name, list, or dict
        Colors to use for the different levels of the ``hue`` variable. Should
        be something that can be interpreted by :func:`color_palette`, or a
        dictionary mapping hue levels to matplotlib colors.    
    col_wrap : int
        "Wrap" the column variable at this width, so that the column facets
        span multiple rows. Incompatible with a ``row`` facet.    
    height : scalar
        Height (in inches) of each facet. See also: ``aspect``.    
    aspect : scalar
        Aspect ratio of each facet, so that ``aspect * height`` gives the width
        of each facet in inches.    
    markers : matplotlib marker code or list of marker codes, optional
        Markers for the scatterplot. If a list, each marker in the list will be
        used for each level of the ``hue`` variable.
    share{x,y} : bool, 'col', or 'row' optional
        If true, the facets will share y axes across columns and/or x axes
        across rows.    

        .. deprecated:: 0.12.0
            Pass using the `facet_kws` dictionary.

    {hue,col,row}_order : lists, optional
        Order for the levels of the faceting variables. By default, this will
        be the order that the levels appear in ``data`` or, if the variables
        are pandas categoricals, the category order.
    legend : bool, optional
        If ``True`` and there is a ``hue`` variable, add a legend.
    legend_out : bool
        If ``True``, the figure size will be extended, and the legend will be
        drawn outside the plot on the center right.    

        .. deprecated:: 0.12.0
            Pass using the `facet_kws` dictionary.

    x_estimator : callable that maps vector -> scalar, optional
        Apply this function to each unique value of ``x`` and plot the
        resulting estimate. This is useful when ``x`` is a discrete variable.
        If ``x_ci`` is given, this estimate will be bootstrapped and a
        confidence interval will be drawn.    
    x_bins : int or vector, optional
        Bin the ``x`` variable into discrete bins and then estimate the central
        tendency and a confidence interval. This binning only influences how
        the scatterplot is drawn; the regression is still fit to the original
        data.  This parameter is interpreted either as the number of
        evenly-sized (not necessary spaced) bins or the positions of the bin
        centers. When this parameter is used, it implies that the default of
        ``x_estimator`` is ``numpy.mean``.    
    x_ci : "ci", "sd", int in [0, 100] or None, optional
        Size of the confidence interval used when plotting a central tendency
        for discrete values of ``x``. If ``"ci"``, defer to the value of the
        ``ci`` parameter. If ``"sd"``, skip bootstrapping and show the
        standard deviation of the observations in each bin.    
    scatter : bool, optional
        If ``True``, draw a scatterplot with the underlying observations (or
        the ``x_estimator`` values).    
    fit_reg : bool, optional
        If ``True``, estimate and plot a regression model relating the ``x``
        and ``y`` variables.    
    ci : int in [0, 100] or None, optional
        Size of the confidence interval for the regression estimate. This will
        be drawn using translucent bands around the regression line. The
        confidence interval is estimated using a bootstrap; for large
        datasets, it may be advisable to avoid that computation by setting
        this parameter to None.    
    n_boot : int, optional
        Number of bootstrap resamples used to estimate the ``ci``. The default
        value attempts to balance time and stability; you may want to increase
        this value for "final" versions of plots.    
    units : variable name in ``data``, optional
        If the ``x`` and ``y`` observations are nested within sampling units,
        those can be specified here. This will be taken into account when
        computing the confidence intervals by performing a multilevel bootstrap
        that resamples both units and observations (within unit). This does not
        otherwise influence how the regression is estimated or drawn.    
    seed : int, numpy.random.Generator, or numpy.random.RandomState, optional
        Seed or random number generator for reproducible bootstrapping.    
    order : int, optional
        If ``order`` is greater than 1, use ``numpy.polyfit`` to estimate a
        polynomial regression.    
    logistic : bool, optional
        If ``True``, assume that ``y`` is a binary variable and use
        ``statsmodels`` to estimate a logistic regression model. Note that this
        is substantially more computationally intensive than linear regression,
        so you may wish to decrease the number of bootstrap resamples
        (``n_boot``) or set ``ci`` to None.    
    lowess : bool, optional
        If ``True``, use ``statsmodels`` to estimate a nonparametric lowess
        model (locally weighted linear regression). Note that confidence
        intervals cannot currently be drawn for this kind of model.    
    robust : bool, optional
        If ``True``, use ``statsmodels`` to estimate a robust regression. This
        will de-weight outliers. Note that this is substantially more
        computationally intensive than standard linear regression, so you may
        wish to decrease the number of bootstrap resamples (``n_boot``) or set
        ``ci`` to None.    
    logx : bool, optional
        If ``True``, estimate a linear regression of the form y ~ log(x), but
        plot the scatterplot and regression model in the input space. Note that
        ``x`` must be positive for this to work.    
    {x,y}_partial : strings in ``data`` or matrices
        Confounding variables to regress out of the ``x`` or ``y`` variables
        before plotting.    
    truncate : bool, optional
        If ``True``, the regression line is bounded by the data limits. If
        ``False``, it extends to the ``x`` axis limits.

    {x,y}_jitter : floats, optional
        Add uniform random noise of this size to either the ``x`` or ``y``
        variables. The noise is added to a copy of the data after fitting the
        regression, and only influences the look of the scatterplot. This can
        be helpful when plotting variables that take discrete values.    
    {scatter,line}_kws : dictionaries
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to ``plt.scatter`` and
        ``plt.plot``.    
    facet_kws : dict
        Dictionary of keyword arguments for :class:`FacetGrid`.

    See Also

    regplot : Plot data and a conditional model fit.
    FacetGrid : Subplot grid for plotting conditional relationships.
    pairplot : Combine :func:`regplot` and :class:`PairGrid` (when used with
               ``kind="reg"``).

    Notes
    -----

    The :func:`regplot` and :func:`lmplot` functions are closely related, but
    the former is an axes-level function while the latter is a figure-level
    function that combines :func:`regplot` and :class:`FacetGrid`.

    See Also
    --------
    lmplot : Combine :func:`regplot` and :class:`FacetGrid` to plot multiple

    jointplot : Combine :func:`regplot` and :class:`JointGrid` (when used with
                ``kind="reg"``).
    pairplot : Combine :func:`regplot` and :class:`PairGrid` (when used with
               ``kind="reg"``).
    residplot : Plot the residuals of a linear regression model.

    Notes
    -----

    The :func:`regplot` and :func:`lmplot` functions are closely related, but
    the former is an axes-level function while the latter is a figure-level
    function that combines :func:`regplot` and :class:`FacetGrid`.    


    It's also easy to combine :func:`regplot` and :class:`JointGrid` or
    :class:`PairGrid` through the :func:`jointplot` and :func:`pairplot`
    functions, although these do not directly accept all of :func:`regplot`'s
    parameters.

        polynomial regression.    
    logistic : bool, optional
        If ``True``, assume that ``y`` is a binary variable and use
        ``statsmodels`` to estimate a logistic regression model. Note that this
        is substantially more computationally intensive than linear regression,
        so you may wish to decrease the number of bootstrap resamples
        (``n_boot``) or set ``ci`` to None.    
    lowess : bool, optional
        If ``True``, use ``statsmodels`` to estimate a nonparametric lowess
        model (locally weighted linear regression). Note that confidence
        intervals cannot currently be drawn for this kind of model.    
    robust : bool, optional
        If ``True``, use ``statsmodels`` to estimate a robust regression. This
        will de-weight outliers. Note that this is substantially more
        computationally intensive than standard linear regression, so you may
        wish to decrease the number of bootstrap resamples (``n_boot``) or set
        ``ci`` to None.    
    logx : bool, optional
        If ``True``, estimate a linear regression of the form y ~ log(x), but
        plot the scatterplot and regression model in the input space. Note that
        ``x`` must be positive for this to work.    
    {x,y}_partial : strings in ``data`` or matrices
        Confounding variables to regress out of the ``x`` or ``y`` variables
        before plotting.    
    truncate : bool, optional
        If ``True``, the regression line is bounded by the data limits. If
        ``False``, it extends to the ``x`` axis limits.

    {x,y}_jitter : floats, optional
        Add uniform random noise of this size to either the ``x`` or ``y``
        variables. The noise is added to a copy of the data after fitting the
        regression, and only influences the look of the scatterplot. This can
        be helpful when plotting variables that take discrete values.    
    label : string
        Label to apply to either the scatterplot or regression line (if
        ``scatter`` is ``False``) for use in a legend.
    color : matplotlib color
        Color to apply to all plot elements; will be superseded by colors
        passed in ``scatter_kws`` or ``line_kws``.
    marker : matplotlib marker code
        Marker to use for the scatterplot glyphs.
    {scatter,line}_kws : dictionaries
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to ``plt.scatter`` and
        ``plt.plot``.    
    ax : matplotlib Axes, optional
        Axes object to draw the plot onto, otherwise uses the current Axes.

    Returns
    -------
    ax : matplotlib Axes
        The Axes object containing the plot.

    Notes
    -----

    The :func:`regplot` and :func:`lmplot` functions are closely related, but
    the former is an axes-level function while the latter is a figure-level
    function that combines :func:`regplot` and :class:`FacetGrid`.    


    It's also easy to combine :func:`regplot` and :class:`JointGrid` or
    :class:`PairGrid` through the :func:`jointplot` and :func:`pairplot`
    functions, although these do not directly accept all of :func:`regplot`'s
    parameters.
