class SocketIO:
    """
    Create a Flask-SocketIO server.

    :param app: The flask application instance. If the application instance
                isn't known at the time this class is instantiated, then call
                ``socketio.init_app(app)`` once the application instance is
                available.
    :param manage_session: If set to ``True``, this extension manages the user
                           session for Socket.IO events. If set to ``False``,
                           Flask's own session management is used. When using
                           Flask's cookie based sessions it is recommended that
                           you leave this set to the default of ``True``. When
                           using server-side sessions, a ``False`` setting
                           enables sharing the user session between HTTP routes
                           and Socket.IO events.
    :param message_queue: A connection URL for a message queue service the
                          server can use for multi-process communication. A
                          message queue is not required when using a single
                          server process.
    :param channel: The channel name, when using a message queue. If a channel
                    isn't specified, a default channel will be used. If
                    multiple clusters of SocketIO processes need to use the
                    same message queue without interfering with each other,
                    then each cluster should use a different channel.
    :param path: The path where the Socket.IO server is exposed. Defaults to
                 ``'socket.io'``. Leave this as is unless you know what you are
                 doing.
    :param resource: Alias to ``path``.
    :param kwargs: Socket.IO and Engine.IO server options.

    The Socket.IO server options are detailed below:

    :param client_manager: The client manager instance that will manage the
                           client list. When this is omitted, the client list
                           is stored in an in-memory structure, so the use of
                           multiple connected servers is not possible.
    :param logger: To enable logging set to ``True`` or pass a logger object to
                   use. To disable logging set to ``False``. The default is
                   ``False``. Note that fatal errors are logged even when
                   ``logger`` is ``False``.
    :param serializer: The serialization method to use when transmitting
                       packets. Valid values are ``'default'``, ``'pickle'``,
                       ``'msgpack'`` and ``'cbor'``. Alternatively, a subclass
                       of the :class:`Packet` class with custom implementations
                       of the ``encode()`` and ``decode()`` methods can be
                       provided. Client and server must use compatible
                       serializers.
    :param json: An alternative JSON module to use for encoding and decoding
                 packets. Custom json modules must have ``dumps`` and ``loads``
                 functions that are compatible with the standard library
                 versions. This is a process-wide setting, all instantiated
                 servers and clients must use the same JSON module.
    :param async_handlers: If set to ``True``, event handlers for a client are
                           executed in separate threads. To run handlers for a
                           client synchronously, set to ``False``. The default
                           is ``True``.
    :param always_connect: When set to ``False``, new connections are
                           provisory until the connect handler returns
                           something other than ``False``, at which point they
                           are accepted. When set to ``True``, connections are
                           immediately accepted, and then if the connect
                           handler returns ``False`` a disconnect is issued.
                           Set to ``True`` if you need to emit events from the
                           connect handler and your client is confused when it
                           receives events before the connection acceptance.
                           In any other case use the default of ``False``.
    :param namespaces: a list of namespaces that are accepted, in addition to
                       any namespaces for which handlers have been defined. The
                       default is `['/']`, which always accepts connections to
                       the default namespace. Set to `'*'` to accept all
                       namespaces.

    The Engine.IO server configuration supports the following settings:

    :param async_mode: The asynchronous model to use. See the Deployment
                       section in the documentation for a description of the
                       available options. Valid async modes are "threading",
                       "eventlet", "gevent" and "gevent_uwsgi". If this
                       argument is not given, "eventlet" is tried first, then
                       "gevent_uwsgi", then "gevent", and finally "threading".
                       The first async mode that has all its dependencies
                       installed is the one that is chosen.
    :param ping_interval: The interval in seconds at which the server pings
                          the client. The default is 25 seconds. For advanced
                          control, a two element tuple can be given, where
                          the first number is the ping interval and the second
                          is a grace period added by the server.
    :param ping_timeout: The time in seconds that the client waits for the
                         server to respond before disconnecting. The default
                         is 20 seconds.
    :param max_http_buffer_size: The maximum size that is accepted for incoming
                                 messages.  The default is 1,000,000 bytes. In
                                 spite of its name, the value set in this
                                 argument is enforced for HTTP long-polling and
                                 WebSocket connections.
    :param allow_upgrades: Whether to allow transport upgrades or not. The
                           default is ``True``.
    :param http_compression: Whether to compress packages when using the
                             polling transport. The default is ``True``.
    :param compression_threshold: Only compress messages when their byte size
                                  is greater than this value. The default is
                                  1024 bytes.
    :param cookie: If set to a string, it is the name of the HTTP cookie the
                   server sends back tot he client containing the client
                   session id. If set to a dictionary, the ``'name'`` key
                   contains the cookie name and other keys define cookie
                   attributes, where the value of each attribute can be a
                   string, a callable with no arguments, or a boolean. If set
                   to ``None`` (the default), a cookie is not sent to the
                   client.
    :param cors_allowed_origins: Origin or list of origins that are allowed to
                                 connect to this server. Only the same origin
                                 is allowed by default. Set this argument to
                                 ``'*'`` or ``['*']`` to allow all origins, or
                                 to ``[]`` to disable CORS handling.
    :param cors_credentials: Whether credentials (cookies, authentication) are
                             allowed in requests to this server. The default
                             is ``True``.
    :param monitor_clients: If set to ``True``, a background task will ensure
                            inactive clients are closed. Set to ``False`` to
                            disable the monitoring task (not recommended). The
                            default is ``True``.
    :param transports: The list of allowed transports. Valid transports
                       are ``'polling'`` and ``'websocket'``. Defaults to
                       ``['polling', 'websocket']``.
    :param engineio_logger: To enable Engine.IO logging set to ``True`` or pass
                            a logger object to use. To disable logging set to
                            ``False``. The default is ``False``. Note that
                            fatal errors are logged even when
                            ``engineio_logger`` is ``False``.
