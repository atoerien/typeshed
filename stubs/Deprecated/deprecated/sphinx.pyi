Sphinx directive integration
============================

We usually need to document the life-cycle of functions and classes:
when they are created, modified or deprecated.

To do that, `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ has a set
of `Paragraph-level markups <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/para.html>`_:

- ``versionadded``: to document the version of the project which added the described feature to the library,
- ``versionchanged``: to document changes of a feature,
- ``deprecated``: to document a deprecated feature.

The purpose of this module is to defined decorators which adds this Sphinx directives
to the docstring of your function and classes.

Of course, the ``@deprecated`` decorator will emit a deprecation warning
when the function/method is called or the class is constructed.
