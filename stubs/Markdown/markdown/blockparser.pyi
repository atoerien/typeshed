"""
The block parser handles basic parsing of Markdown blocks.  It doesn't concern
itself with inline elements such as `**bold**` or `*italics*`, but rather just
catches blocks, lists, quotes, etc.

The `BlockParser` is made up of a bunch of `BlockProcessors`, each handling a
different type of block. Extensions may add/replace/remove `BlockProcessors`
as they need to alter how Markdown blocks are parsed.

    Track the current and nested state of the parser.

    This utility class is used to track the state of the `BlockParser` and
    support multiple levels if nesting. It's just a simple API wrapped around
    a list. Each time a state is set, that state is appended to the end of the
    list. Each time a state is reset, that state is removed from the end of
    the list.

    Therefore, each time a state is set for a nested block, that state must be
    reset when we back out of that level of nesting or the state could be
    corrupted.

    While all the methods of a list object are available, only the three
