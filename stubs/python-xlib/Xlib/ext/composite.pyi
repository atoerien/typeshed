"""
Composite extension, allowing windows to be rendered to off-screen
storage.

For detailed description, see the protocol specification at
http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/CompositeExt

By itself this extension is not very useful, it is intended to be used
together with the DAMAGE and XFIXES extensions.  Typically you would
also need RENDER or glX or some similar method of creating fancy
graphics.
