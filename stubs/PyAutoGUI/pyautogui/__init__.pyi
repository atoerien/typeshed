    The ``interval`` argument is an int or float of how many seconds to wait in between each click, if ``clicks`` is
    greater than ``1``. It defaults to ``0.0`` for no pause in between clicks.

    The ``button`` argument is one of the constants ``LEFT``, ``MIDDLE``, ``RIGHT``, ``PRIMARY``, or ``SECONDARY``.

    left-handed users.)
