    A collection of one or more Points.

    A MultiPoint has zero area and zero length.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : sequence
        A sequence of Points, or a sequence of (x, y [,z]) numeric coordinate
        pairs or triples, or an array-like of shape (N, 2) or (N, 3).

    Attributes
    ----------
    geoms : sequence
        A sequence of Points

    Examples
    --------
    Construct a MultiPoint containing two Points

    >>> from shapely import MultiPoint, Point
    >>> ob = MultiPoint([[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0]])

        ----------
        scale_factor : float

        opacity : float
            Float number between 0 and 1 for color opacity. Default value is 0.6
