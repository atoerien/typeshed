class MultiPolygon(BaseMultipartGeometry[Polygon]):

    A collection of one or more Polygons.

    If component polygons overlap the collection is invalid and some
    operations on it may fail.

    Parameters
    ----------
    polygons : sequence
        A sequence of Polygons, or a sequence of (shell, holes) tuples
        where shell is the sequence representation of a linear ring
        (see LinearRing) and holes is a sequence of such linear rings.

    Attributes
    ----------
    geoms : sequence
        A sequence of `Polygon` instances

    Examples
    --------
    Construct a MultiPolygon from a sequence of coordinate tuples

    >>> from shapely import MultiPolygon, Polygon
    >>> ob = MultiPolygon([
    ...     (
    ...     ((0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 0.0)),

        ----------
        scale_factor : float
            Multiplication factor for the SVG stroke-width.  Default is 1.
        fill_color : str, optional
            Hex string for fill color. Default is to use "#66cc99" if

        opacity : float
            Float number between 0 and 1 for color opacity. Default value is 0.6
