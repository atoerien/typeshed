    """
    A geometry type that represents a single coordinate.

    Each coordinate has x, y and possibly z and/or m values.

    A point is a zero-dimensional feature and has zero length and zero area.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args : float, or sequence of floats
        The coordinates can either be passed as a single parameter, or as
        individual float values using multiple parameters:

        1) 1 parameter: a sequence or array-like of with 2 or 3 values.
        2) 2 or 3 parameters (float): x, y, and possibly z.

    Attributes
    ----------
    x, y, z, m : float
        Coordinate values

    Examples
    --------
    Constructing the Point using separate parameters for x and y:

    >>> from shapely import Point
    >>> p = Point(1.0, -1.0)

    Constructing the Point using a list of x, y coordinates:

    >>> p = Point([1.0, -1.0])
    >>> print(p)
    POINT (1 -1)
    >>> p.y
    -1.0
    >>> p.x
    1.0
