class LinearRing(LineString):
    """
    Geometry type composed of one or more line segments that forms a closed loop.

    A LinearRing is a closed, one-dimensional feature.
    A LinearRing that crosses itself or touches itself at a single point is
    invalid and operations on it may fail.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates : sequence
        A sequence of (x, y [,z]) numeric coordinate pairs or triples, or
        an array-like with shape (N, 2) or (N, 3).
        Also can be a sequence of Point objects.

    Notes
    -----
    Rings are automatically closed. There is no need to specify a final
    coordinate pair identical to the first.

    Examples
    --------
    Construct a square ring.

    >>> ring = LinearRing( ((0, 0), (0, 1), (1 ,1 ), (1 , 0)) )

class Polygon(BaseGeometry):
    """
    A geometry type representing an area that is enclosed by a linear ring.

    A polygon is a two-dimensional feature and has a non-zero area. It may
    have one or more negative-space "holes" which are also bounded by linear
    rings. If any rings cross each other, the feature is invalid and
    operations on it may fail.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shell : sequence
        A sequence of (x, y [,z]) numeric coordinate pairs or triples, or
        an array-like with shape (N, 2) or (N, 3).
        Also can be a sequence of Point objects.
    holes : sequence
        A sequence of objects which satisfy the same requirements as the
        shell parameters above

    Attributes
    ----------
    exterior : LinearRing
        The ring which bounds the positive space of the polygon.
    interiors : sequence
        A sequence of rings which bound all existing holes.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a square polygon with no holes

    >>> from shapely import Polygon
    >>> coords = ((0., 0.), (0., 1.), (1., 1.), (1., 0.), (0., 0.))

    ----------
    polygon : shapely.Polygon
    sign : float, default 1.
        The sign of the result's signed area.
        A non-negative sign means that the coordinates of the geometry's exterior
