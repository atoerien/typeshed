    A geometry type composed of one or more line segments.

    A LineString is a one-dimensional feature and has a non-zero length but
    zero area. It may approximate a curve and need not be straight. A LineString may
    be closed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates : sequence
        A sequence of (x, y, [,z]) numeric coordinate pairs or triples, or
        an array-like with shape (N, 2) or (N, 3).
        Also can be a sequence of Point objects, or combination of both.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a LineString with two segments

    >>> from shapely import LineString
    >>> a = LineString([[0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1]])
    >>> a.length

        ----------
        scale_factor : float

        stroke_color : str, optional
            Hex string for stroke color. Default is to use "#66cc99" if
            geometry is valid, and "#ff3333" if invalid.
        opacity : float

        """
        Return a (Multi)LineString at a distance from the object.

        The side, left or right, is determined by the sign of the `distance`
        parameter (negative for right side offset, positive for left side
        offset). The resolution of the buffer around each vertex of the object
        increases by increasing the `quad_segs` keyword parameter.

        The join style is for outside corners between line segments. Accepted
        values are JOIN_STYLE.round (1), JOIN_STYLE.mitre (2), and
        JOIN_STYLE.bevel (3).

        The mitre ratio limit is used for very sharp corners. It is the ratio
        of the distance from the corner to the end of the mitred offset corner.
        When two line segments meet at a sharp angle, a miter join will extend
        far beyond the original geometry. To prevent unreasonable geometry, the
        mitre limit allows controlling the maximum length of the join corner.
        Corners with a ratio which exceed the limit will be beveled.

        Note: the behaviour regarding orientation of the resulting line
        depends on the GEOS version. With GEOS < 3.11, the line retains the
        same direction for a left offset (positive distance) or has reverse
        direction for a right offset (negative distance), and this behaviour
        was documented as such in previous Shapely versions. Starting with
        GEOS 3.11, the function tries to preserve the orientation of the
        original line.
