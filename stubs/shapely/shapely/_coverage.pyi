def coverage_simplify(geometry: Polygon, tolerance: ArrayLike[float], *, simplify_boundary: bool = True) -> Polygon:
    """
    Return a simplified version of an input geometry using coverage simplification.

    Assumes that the geometry forms a polygonal coverage. Under this assumption, the
    function simplifies the edges using the Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithm, while
    preserving a valid coverage. In the most simplified case, polygons are reduced to
    triangles.

    A collection of valid polygons is considered a coverage if the polygons are:

    * **Non-overlapping** - polygons do not overlap (their interiors do not intersect)
    * **Edge-Matched** - vertices along shared edges are identical

    The function allows simplification of all edges including the outer boundaries of
    the coverage or simplification of only the inner (shared) edges.

    If there are other geometry types than Polygons or MultiPolygons present,
    the function will raise an error.

    If the geometry is polygonal but does not form a valid coverage due to overlaps,
    it will be simplified but it may result in invalid topology.

    .. versionadded:: 2.1.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometry : Geometry or array_like
    tolerance : float or array_like
        The degree of simplification roughly equal to the square root of the area
        of triangles that will be removed.
    simplify_boundary : bool, optional
        By default (True), simplifies both internal edges of the coverage as well
        as its boundary. If set to False, only simplifies internal edges.

    Returns
