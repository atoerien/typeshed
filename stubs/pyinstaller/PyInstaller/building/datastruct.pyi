    PYZ         Runtime name.          Full path name in build.    A .pyz archive (ZlibArchive data structure).

    A TOC contains various types of files. A TOC contains no duplicates and preserves order.
    PyInstaller uses TOC data type to collect necessary files bundle them into an executable.
