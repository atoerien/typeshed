    Manage the parallelism and checker instances for each plugin and file.

    This class will be responsible for the following:

    - Determining the parallelism of Flake8, e.g.:

      * Do we use :mod:`multiprocessing` or is it unavailable?

      * Do we automatically decide on the number of jobs to use or did the
        user provide that?

    - Falling back to a serial way of processing files if we run into an
      OSError related to :mod:`multiprocessing`

    - Organizing the results of each checker so we can group the output
      together and make our output deterministic.
