    SequenceMatcher is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of
    any type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable.  The basic
    algorithm predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm
    published in the late 1980's by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the
    hyperbolic name "gestalt pattern matching".  The basic idea is to find
    the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no "junk"
    elements (R-O doesn't address junk).  The same idea is then applied
    recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right
    of the matching subsequence.  This does not yield minimal edit
    sequences, but does tend to yield matches that "look right" to people.

    SequenceMatcher tries to compute a "human-friendly diff" between two
    sequences.  Unlike e.g. UNIX(tm) diff, the fundamental notion is the
    longest *contiguous* & junk-free matching subsequence.  That's what
    catches peoples' eyes.  The Windows(tm) windiff has another interesting
    notion, pairing up elements that appear uniquely in each sequence.
    That, and the method here, appear to yield more intuitive difference
    reports than does diff.  This method appears to be the least vulnerable
    to syncing up on blocks of "junk lines", though (like blank lines in
    ordinary text files, or maybe "<P>" lines in HTML files).  That may be
    because this is the only method of the 3 that has a *concept* of
    "junk" <wink>.

    Example, comparing two strings, and considering blanks to be "junk":

    >>> s = SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x == " ",
    ...                     "private Thread currentThread;",
    ...                     "private volatile Thread currentThread;")
    >>>

    .ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the "similarity" of the
    sequences.  As a rule of thumb, a .ratio() value over 0.6 means the
    sequences are close matches:

    >>> print(round(s.ratio(), 2))
    0.87
    >>>

    If you're only interested in where the sequences match,
    .get_matching_blocks() is handy:

    >>> for block in s.get_matching_blocks():
    ...     print("a[%d] and b[%d] match for %d elements" % block)
    a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements
    a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements
    a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements

    Note that the last tuple returned by .get_matching_blocks() is always a
    dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0), and this is the only case in which the last
    tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0.

    If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second,
    use .get_opcodes():

    >>> for opcode in s.get_opcodes():
    ...     print("%6s a[%d:%d] b[%d:%d]" % opcode)
     equal a[0:8] b[0:8]
    insert a[8:8] b[8:17]
     equal a[8:29] b[17:38]

    See the Differ class for a fancy human-friendly file differencer, which
    uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    See also function get_close_matches() in this module, which shows how
    simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work.

    Timing:  Basic R-O is cubic time worst case and quadratic time expected
    case.  SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has
    expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many
    elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear.

class Differ:
    r"""
    Differ is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, and
    producing human-readable differences or deltas.  Differ uses
    SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare
    sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines.

    Each line of a Differ delta begins with a two-letter code:

        '- '    line unique to sequence 1
        '+ '    line unique to sequence 2
        '  '    line common to both sequences
        '? '    line not present in either input sequence

    Lines beginning with '? ' attempt to guide the eye to intraline
    differences, and were not present in either input sequence.  These lines
    can be confusing if the sequences contain tab characters.

    Note that Differ makes no claim to produce a *minimal* diff.  To the
    contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they synch
    up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages apart.
    Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of
    locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff.

    Example: Comparing two texts.

    First we set up the texts, sequences of individual single-line strings
    ending with newlines (such sequences can also be obtained from the
    `readlines()` method of file-like objects):

    >>> text1 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    ...   3. Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)
    >>> len(text1)
    4
    >>> text1[0][-1]
    '\n'
    >>> text2 = '''  1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    ...   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ...   4. Complicated is better than complex.
    ...   5. Flat is better than nested.
    ... '''.splitlines(keepends=True)

    Next we instantiate a Differ object:

    >>> d = Differ()

    Note that when instantiating a Differ object we may pass functions to
    filter out line and character 'junk'.  See Differ.__init__ for details.

    Finally, we compare the two:

    >>> result = list(d.compare(text1, text2))

    'result' is a list of strings, so let's pretty-print it:

    >>> from pprint import pprint as _pprint
    >>> _pprint(result)
    ['    1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\n',
     '-   2. Explicit is better than implicit.\n',
     '-   3. Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '+   3.   Simple is better than complex.\n',
     '?     ++\n',
     '-   4. Complex is better than complicated.\n',
     '?            ^                     ---- ^\n',
     '+   4. Complicated is better than complex.\n',
     '?           ++++ ^                      ^\n',
     '+   5. Flat is better than nested.\n']

    As a single multi-line string it looks like this:

    >>> print(''.join(result), end="")
        1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
    -   2. Explicit is better than implicit.
    -   3. Simple is better than complex.
    +   3.   Simple is better than complex.
    ?     ++
    -   4. Complex is better than complicated.
    ?            ^                     ---- ^
    +   4. Complicated is better than complex.
    ?           ++++ ^                      ^
    +   5. Flat is better than nested.

        The two optional keyword parameters are for filter functions:

        - `linejunk`: A function that should accept a single string argument,

          an adaptive notion of "noise" lines that's better than any static

        - `charjunk`: A function that should accept a string of length 1. The
          module-level function `IS_CHARACTER_JUNK` may be used to filter out

    Optional keyword parameters `linejunk` and `charjunk` are for filter
    functions, or can be None:

    - linejunk: A function that should accept a single string argument and
      return true iff the string is junk.  The default is None, and is
      recommended; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has an adaptive
      notion of "noise" lines.

    - charjunk: A function that accepts a character (string of length
      1), and returns true iff the character is junk. The default is
      the module-level function IS_CHARACTER_JUNK, which filters out
      whitespace characters (a blank or tab; note: it's a bad idea to
      include newline in this!).

    Tools/scripts/ndiff.py is a command-line front-end to this function.

    Example:

    >>> diff = ndiff('one\ntwo\nthree\n'.splitlines(keepends=True),
    ...              'ore\ntree\nemu\n'.splitlines(keepends=True))
    >>> print(''.join(diff), end="")

class HtmlDiff:

    For producing HTML side by side comparison with change highlights.

    This class can be used to create an HTML table (or a complete HTML file
    containing the table) showing a side by side, line by line comparison
    of text with inter-line and intra-line change highlights.  The table can
    be generated in either full or contextual difference mode.

    The following methods are provided for HTML generation:

    make_table -- generates HTML for a single side by side table
    make_file -- generates complete HTML file with a single side by side table

    See tools/scripts/diff.py for an example usage of this class.
